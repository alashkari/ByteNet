The key concept of FF is a schedule timetable to ensure that all messages are transferred to correct destination nodes within a prescribed time. 
This contributes to FF capability of timely information access. 
The schedule timetable acts as a manager that control information traffic; it determines when a message is sent, what message is to be sent, where it should be sent, etc. 
Schedule timetable is in essence an algorithm of information execution, and the content can differ from one algorithm to another; however, the massages usually include:
 periodic data (synchronous)
 request from user (asynchronous)
 request from devices (asynchronous)
Numerical analyses have been developed by adopting the extended finite element method (XFEM), a tool very flexible in treating computational problems involving discontinuities for the fields under scrutiny. 
The computational technique used in the example presented here follows strictly the method described in [StBCB] and [StCMB]: it combines the enlargement of the approximation space at nodes around the crack (XFEM) with a level-set description of the crack itself. 
In fact, the crack is not considered as a part of the boundary, rather the level set of a signed distance function _MATHDISP_, a function approximated by the expression _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the number of nodes of the generic finite element adopted (here _MATH_), _MATH_ is the _MATH_-th shape function and _MATH_ the pertinent nodal value (see [StBCB] and [StCMB] for further details). 
As mentioned above, the peculiar feature of the XFEM is that the approximation spaces of the fields involved are enlarged at nodes around the margins of the crack and around the tip. 
By indicating by _MATH_ the number of nodes of the spatial discretization, by _MATH_ the number of nodes belonging to elements containing the tip of the crack and by _MATH_ the number of nodes belonging to elements completely cut by the crack, the approximation of the displacement field _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are shape functions, _MATH_ is Heaviside step function modified to be symmetric across the crack, and _MATHDISP_, the basis for Westergaard field around the tip, in polar coordinates _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ and _MATH_ represent degrees of freedom additional to the nodal values _MATH_ that are introduced at the nodes of elements crossed by the crack (namely _MATH_) and at the nodes of the elements including the tip (namely _MATH_). 
The above expansion of _MATH_ is popular in the current literature on XFEM. 
Detailed explanations about its nature and motivation can be found in [StBCB] and [StCMB]. 
An analogous approximation is adopted for the morphological descriptor field _MATH_, namely _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
The approximation structure above is the same for _MATH_ for the sake of simplicity. 
The meaning of the relevant symbols is analogous to the approximation of _MATH_. 
Further details about the structure of the algebraic problem resulting from the discretization of the weak form of equilibrium equations are not reported here: they can be found in [MS] (specifically in Sect. 5.3 of that paper), where the standard version of XFEM is adapted to multifield problems.
From (2.33)-(2.35) we know that _MATHDISP_ 
That is to say that Z(v) is the deviation of the frequency response of the differentiator of _REF_ from the frequency response of the ideal differentiator. 
And its relative error is _MATHDISP_
Following Ref. _CITE_, we noted that in the ultra high energy limit where _MATH_ and _MATH_, the effective Friedmann Eq.(_REF_) becomes _MATH_. 
Also, in the intermediate energy region in which _MATH_ but _MATH_, for _MATH_, the effective Friedmann equation can be rewritten by _MATH_. 
Finally, in low energy limit in which _MATH_ the Friedmann Eq.(_REF_) results be _MATH_, where the effective 4-dimensional Planck mass is defined by _MATH_.
Recall, that the absolute motion vector _MATH_ defined in (_REF_) yields the absolute scene flow translation vector. 
Hence, the velocity of an object is the length of this translation vector divided by the time frame in between the two stereo image pairs. 
The (absolute) translation vectors for every image point of a rendered scene with known camera motion (exact values are also known for the disparity _MATH_, the disparity change _MATH_, and the optical flow _MATH_ and _MATH_) are displayed in Fig. _REF_. 
The translation vectors point into the direction of movement for every reconstructed scene flow vector. 
Points which are located on the road surface and background are stationary; hence their vector length is zero. 
In contrast, points which are located on the vehicle are moving and represented by translation vectors.
Prove by the contour integration method the following general formul√¶ _MATHDISP_, By the way, formula b) may be also written in a slightly different form _MATHDISP_.
To further explore the performance of BPSA-1 and BPSA-2 on the estimated standard error of _MATH_, a small simulation study is conducted, replicating frequentist PSA, BPSA-1 and BPSA-2 with several selected priors. 
Again, note that when the prior precision of the propensity score equation _MATH_ or the outcome equation _MATH_ is 0, a noninformative prior for the corresponding equation is used. 
Whereas when the prior precisions _MATH_ or _MATH_ are set to 10, the true prior mean is utilized with prior precision 10 for the parameters of the propensity score equation or the outcome equation. 
The results, averaged over 200 replications, are shown in Table _REF_. 
The sample size _MATH_ is 250 for all approaches shown in Table _REF_, except _MATH_ for BPSA-2 optimal full matching (the last four rows).
At the periphery of the active region 10365, secondary arc-shaped brightenings are observed at the beginning of the main flare on 27 May, 2003. 
These secondary ribbons are visible in H_MATH_ (R_MATH_, R_MATH_ in Figure 6) and in EUV (SOHO/EIT Figure 7)
The Gribov-Zwanziger Lagrangian is a formulation of the Landau gauge fixed Yang-Mills theories where the Gribov problem is incorporated in a localized way, _CITE_. 
This problem, _CITE_, essentially relates to the difficulties in fixing a gauge globally for gauge theories with a non-abelian symmetry. 
In his seminal work, _CITE_, Gribov demonstrated that globally different gauge configurations could satisfy the same gauge condition thereby introducing an ambiguity into the gauge fixing procedure. 
Such Gribov copies do not affect the local gauge fixing in Yang-Mills theories and hence the ultraviolet structure of such theories does not encounter gauge fixing difficulties. 
By contrast, the problem relates to global issues and hence the infrared regime of the theory. 
For non-abelian gauge theories, Gribov indicated that such gauge copies could be entangled with the problem of confinement, _CITE_, which is sometimes referred to as infrared slavery. 
One consequence of the analysis of _CITE_ is to overcome the copy problem in the main by restricting the path integral to a specific region of configuration space. 
This region, known as the Gribov region, denoted by _MATH_ and containing the origin, is defined by the locus of points where the Faddeev-Popov operator is positive, _CITE_. 
Geometrical aspects of the region and their consequences have been explored in _CITE_. 
As an aside we note that such a restriction does not lead to unambiguous gauge configurations. 
Instead the Gribov region has a subregion called the Fundamental Modular Region, denoted by _MATH_, where the gauge is fixed uniquely globally. 
However, it has been argued in _CITE_ that Green's functions defined over _MATH_ and _MATH_ are equivalent. 
To incorporate the path integral restriction to _MATH_ Gribov modified the Yang-Mills action to include a non-local operator which in effect cut off the domain of integration, _CITE_. 
The presence of such an operator, referred to as the horizon or no pole condition, introduces an arbitrary mass scale, _MATH_, which is known as the Gribov mass. 
However, it is not a new parameter of the theory but satisfies a gap equation defined by the defining horizon condition and is a function of the coupling constant, _CITE_. 
The presence of this non-local operator and the Gribov mass alters the structure of the propagators of the theory. 
For instance, the gluon has a propagator which vanishes at zero momentum and depends on the Gribov mass. 
Though it has a non-fundamental form with the gluon being in effect massless but with a non-zero width, _CITE_. 
This may appear to be contradictory but the gluon is not a fundamental field in itself as it is confined. 
A second feature is that as a consequence of the gap equation for _MATH_, the Faddeev-Popov ghost propagator has an enhanced or dipole behaviour in the zero momentum limit. 
The latter property was later encapsulated in the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion, _CITE_, for the Landau gauge. 
Indeed this condition has been re-examined in the Gribov-Zwanziger context in _CITE_.
Proof : 
On the interval _MATH_ first take the scalar product of (_REF_) with _MATH_, divide by _MATH_, and then multiply by _MATH_ (which could take either sign) to obtain (for _MATH_) _MATHDISP_. 
Next integrate over the volume, invoke the Divergence Theorem and the boundary conditions on _MATH_ and finally use Holder's inequality to obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Using the standard notation _MATH_, (_REF_) reduces to _MATHDISP_, which integrates to _MATHDISP_, in the limit _MATH_ (_MATH_ is bounded). 
Provided _MATH_ has no zero in its initial data, the log-singularity at _MATH_ causes the left hand side to blow up at _MATH_ thereby forcing _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
This result could also be obtained using Lagrangian particle paths if one choose that route to perform the analysis. 
Finally, it is immediately clear from (_REF_) that if _MATH_ is finite, then no null can develop in _MATH_, for _MATH_. 
The universe started in a state of extremely high density and temperature and expanded almost explosively since then; this initial stage is called the big bang. 
This phase is very dense and very hot; emission from this phase was postulated in a famous paper by Alpher, Bethe, &amp; Gamow (1948). 
The residual radiation from this background was detected by Penzias &amp; Wilson (1965), and immediately properly explained by Dicke et al. (1965).-This radiation is called the micro-wave-back-ground (MWBG) or cosmic microwave background (CMB).
GA was proposed by John Holland in 1960. 
GA is based on Darwin's theory of evolution: "Survival of The Fittest". 
It is an evolutionary algorithm which is most widely applied on solving optimization problems. 
The algorithm claims that the nature of biological evolution is in the genes. 
Biological characteristics of each species are passed down through gene sequencing from previous generations. 
"Survival of the Fittest" means that this generation genes are superior compared to its previous generation, and it is more likely to be survived in the environment. 
GA solves problems through gene encoding using a set of parameters while simulating the natural evolution process: selection, crossover, and mutation to find an optimal solution. 
Based on the characteristic of GA which is similar to natural human evolution, natural crossover and mutation, we can create a new generation in which the performance of each offspring is better than that of the preceding generation. 
Hence, the optimization and convergence performance of the solution can be obtained [6-7].
First of all, we show that _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be a sequence of positive numbers such that _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Set _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Then, for all _MATH_ with _MATH_, taking (_REF_) into account, one has _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_. 
Then, for all _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_, from the assumption _MATH_ and the condition (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_, and combining the assumption _MATH_, we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
This implies that _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ be fixed. 
We claim that the functional _MATH_ is unbounded from below. 
Since _MATHDISP_, there exist a sequence _MATH_ of positive numbers and _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_, for each _MATH_ large enough. 
For all _MATH_ we define _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_. 
From the condition _MATH_, it is easy to verify that _MATH_. 
For any _MATH_, one has _MATHDISP_. 
On the other hand, by (A2) and since _MATH_ is nonnegative, from the definition of _MATH_, we infer _MATHDISP_. 
By (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_, for every _MATH_ large enough. 
Since _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Then, the functional _MATH_ is unbounded from below, and it follows that _MATH_ has no global minimum. 
Therefore, by Theorem _REF_(b), there exists a sequence _MATH_ of critical points of _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, and the conclusion is achieved.
Anyway, for sake of completeness, we mention other approaches: the work of Owen (1972 and 1975), who proposed approximation algorithms based on multilinear extensions for calculating the Shapley-Shubik and the Banzhaf indices, later modified by Leech (2003), who proposed a hybrid with the direct application of the definitions of the indices, and the work of Matsui and Matsui (2000), who showed enumeration algorithms for calculating the two above indices and the Deegan-Packel index.
To make contact with the Bergeron et al _CITE_ formulation of the DCJ distance, we add all contributions from all components to the distance for a general transformation keeping in mind that each cycle, odd and even path contributes according to what was previously found. 
Summing on all components we arrive at: _MATHDISP_, because the total number of genes _MATH_ is equal to _MATH_, the number of cycles is _MATH_, and the total number of odd paths is _MATH_.
For each of the _MATH_ combinations a single instance was randomly generated. 
Each instance was solved 200 times using random starting points in _MATH_.
Fractal theory was originally used for texture description and segmentation. 
It is called Lindenmayer system (L-system) in texture analysis and is mostly based on a recursive, context-free, deterministic grammar _CITE_. 
At each iteration, all applicable rules are applied simultaneously and the expansion is stopped after a predetermined number of iterations. 
In addition to texture, several fractal features and fractal based recognition algorithms have been proposed to classify other patterns like faces _CITE_.
Shucheng Yu et al., _CITE_ proposed a technique that utilizes KP-ABE to protect the data hosted in the cloud server. 
Their technique utilizes Lazy re-encryption to eliminate unnecessary cryptographic overhead after each user revocation. 
With confidential information hosted in the un-trusted domain, lazy re-encryption could create serious privacy issues. 
Imagine the medical record of a person who does not visit doctor frequently as he is living a healthy life, would be available to the revoked users of a cloud based EHR, just for the reason that it is not being modified.
For the third example, we investigate the effect of neglecting the small elastic deformations in equation (_REF_) on the simulation accuracy for the different velocity transformation matrices. 
For this purpose we consider the unbalanced rotating shaft shown in Fig. _REF_. 
It consists of a cylindric component eccentrically connected to two circular rods. 
The rods are connected to spherical joints which are supported by a normal support at one side and a rolling support at the other side. 
The spherical joints are modeled with three hinges in series whose axes are initially aligned with the global _MATH_, _MATH_- and _MATH_-axes. 
The shaft is accelerated around its axis from rest to a constant angular velocity. 
The prescribed spin-up motion, _MATH_, is given by Eq. (_REF_) with a final angular velocity of _MATH_ and a spin-up time of _MATH_. 
Furthermore, the physical properties of the shaft are given in Table _REF_.
Given the power spectrum _MATH_ of the noise _MATH_, we are able to investigate the mean and variance (Appendix B) of the ETFE, as presented in Section 3.1.3. 
It has been shown in _CITE_ that the ETFE approximately satisfies _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ as _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Consequently, the ETFE is an asymptotically unbiased estimate of _MATH_, where in this statistical context bias is defined as the difference between the estimator's expected value (_MATH_) and the true value of the ETFE for a specific frequency (_MATH_). 
However, the variance will not tend to zero for _MATH_ large. 
It approaches the noise-to-input signal ratio at the specific frequency _MATH_. 
A common approach to improve the variance properties of the ETFEis to apply a local averaging procedure, _MATHDISP_ where the frequency weights _MATH_ follow from a good trade-off between bias and variance. 
Typically, the weights are selected according to a frequency window. 
Within this context, the so-called Hamming window is very popular (see for further information, for instance, _CITE_).
Now we pay attention to the terminal set _MATH_ and describe its tent at the point _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the set of the points _MATH_ for which _MATH_ &gt; _MATH_. 
By the agreement accepted above, we may assume that _MATH_ almost everywhere on _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the set of all points _MATH_ satisfying _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Then, _MATH_ is a convex cone with the apex _MATH_. 
One can see that _MATH_ is a tent of _MATH_ at the point _MATH_. 
The polar cone _MATH_ consists of all measurable summable functions _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
This gives the second complementary slackness condition. 
Consider then the set _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the set of the points _MATH_ for which _MATH_. 
By the above agreement, we may again assume that _MATH_ almost everywhere on _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the set of all points _MATH_ with _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is a convex cone with the apex _MATH_. 
It may be easily shown that _MATH_ is a tent of _MATH_ at the point _MATH_.The polar cone _MATH_ consists of all measurable summable functions _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
This gives the first complementary slackness condition.
Graph isomorphism The last example is the problem of finding an isomorphism for two isomorphic graphs. 
The adequate relationship consists of _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a pair of graphs with _MATH_ nodes and _MATH_ is an isomorphism between them. 
Re-randomization generates a random permutation _MATH_ and applies it to the pair of graphs or computes _MATH_, respectively.
Using the ideas of Section _REF_ (see Proposition _REF_) and the convergence concept in variable spaces (see Section _REF_), we state the following result. 
For brevity, hereinafter in this chapter we restrict ourself to the case when the function _MATH_ is kept constant _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
For every bounded sequence _MATH_ such that _MATH_ in _MATH_, the following inequality holds: _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the characteristic functions of the sets _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
Then _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be the characteristic function of the Dirichlet control zone _MATH_; that is, _MATHDISP_. 
To begin, let us show that _MATHDISP_. 
Indeed, in view of _MATH_-periodicity of this characteristic function and the mean value property, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, statement _REF_ holds true.
Since the wind has a uniform velocity (_MATH_), we have _MATH_, so the last term in Equation (_REF_) is function only of _MATH_. 
So, for _MATH_, the temperature is simply a function of the distance _MATH_. 
In contrast to _CITE_, the conclusion is that there is no correlation between _MATH_ and _MATH_ for an adiabatic evolution, unless there was already a correlation close to the Sun [so _MATH_].
The proof works by induction on _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, there is nothing to prove. 
Hence suppose that _MATH_. 
Consider the bipartite graph _MATH_ whose color classes are _MATH_ (the rows of the matrix _MATH_) and _MATH_ (the columns of the matrix _MATH_) and whose edges are those couples _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Define the weight of the corresponding edge to be the real number _MATH_. 
Let us first assume that _MATH_ has at least one matching of cardinality _MATH_, which we may assume to match _MATH_ with the set _MATH_ of the first _MATH_ vertices of _MATH_. 
Let us consider the problem of finding a maximal weight perfect matching between these two sets of vertices. 
The dual linear programming problem reads _MATHDISP_. 
The duality theorem in linear programming shows that this problem has an optimal solution, _MATH_, which, by complementary slackness, is such that _MATH_ for every edge _MATH_ belonging to a perfect matching of maximal weight. 
Moreover, since adding the same constant to the entries of _MATH_ and subtracting it to the entries of _MATH_ does not affect the optimality of _MATH_, we may assume that _MATH_. 
Then, the weights _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_ have the desired properties.
The set of all species hamiltonian hoopings will be denoted by _MATH_.
Given a branching chain system and defining a set of _MATH_ independent task, or operational space, coordinates, _MATH_ we define the task Jacobian as, _MATHDISP_. 
These task space coordinates are related to the generalized coordinates by a functional mapping, and are chosen as a more natural space from which to formulate the control problem. 
As an example, they can be chosen as the Cartesian coordinates of some effector frame of the multibody system. 
As with the constraints, given the stipulation that _MATH_ are independent coordinates it follows that _MATH_ is full rank (rank of _MATH_); that is the rows of _MATH_ are linearly independent. 
Redundant task coordinates will not be addressed in this paper and all subsequent formulations presented here will assume an independent set of task coordinates (and, thus, full rank task Jacobian matrix).
Place a point _MATH_ in the plane and a suitable small scaled down copy of _MATH_ left from _MATH_ such that any translate of _MATH_ with its apex in the neighborhood of _MATH_ contains _MATH_, but none of the translates of _MATH_ with its apex in the neighborhood of _MATH_ does. 
Similarly place _MATH_ such that any translate of _MATH_ with its apex in the neighborhood of _MATH_ contains _MATH_, but none of the translates of _MATH_ with its apex in the neighborhood of _MATH_ does. 
(See Fig. 2.)
The bi-sphere problem can also be solved numerically exactly using, for instance, matrix inversion. 
The number of terms with different angular numbers, which has to be taken into account are determined from convergency of the procedure. 
For computations we chose _MATH_ and spectral interval in the vicinity of resonance frequency of the mode with radial number _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We checked (for a few representative frequencies) that the convergency is achieved if one takes into account all _MATH_, and that the terms with _MATH_ do not change the results significantly. 
Therefore, in order to shorten computational time we carried out most of the calculations taking into account all _MATH_. 
Including all coefficients with _MATH_, is necessary to insure that we include all possible resonance modes that can significantly affect the results.
On the other hand, the C function getrusage() supplies the time in which the specific process loads the processor and it is denoted by _MATH_. 
Then, _MATH_ can be estimated by the relation _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is related to the load of processes on the _MATH_-th processor at _MATH_ time, so when _MATH_ means that the _MATH_-th processor is loaded by several processes. 
Thus, the time _MATH_ is an estimation of the run-time out of the program taking account of the other processes which share the same processor, since the CPU-time is linearly distributed among all processes which are running on the same processor _CITE_.
On the other hand, the set _MATH_ attracts all sets _MATH_ uniformly when _MATH_. 
Then, for all _MATH_, there exists some time _MATH_ which is independent on _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_. 
Choosing _MATH_, and collecting (5.15)-(5.16), we readily get _MATHDISP_.
In the present paper, we will numerically investigate the hyperchaotic system, the minimum orders of the fractional-order systems and the fractional-order SMC for the fractional-order hyperchaotic system. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we introduce the basic dynamical properties of a novel hyperchaotic system in detail. 
Section 3 is on the minimum orders of the fractional-order chaotic and hyperchaotic systems. 
In Section 4, the design procedure of the fractional-order sliding mode approach is presented. 
Section 5 concludes this paper with some additional remarks.
Bit error rate (BER) performances of these two different UWB physical layer solutions have been studied through simulations using two independently developed WBAN radio channel models; IEEE 802.15.6 model _CITE_ and WBAN model developed at the Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland _CITE_. 
Thus both models being WBAN on-body models, their delay profiles are deviating from each other, and hence, the UWB systems' performances when using these models are different. 
The CWC's WBAN radio channel measurements have been carried out at the real hospital environment, accordingly at the Oulu University Hospital. 
Hence, they are reflecting to the real environment; operation room, ward and corridor. 
The CWC's hospital radio channel models are illustrating an on-body link of a laying down patient and also a body-to-external access point link of a standing patient in a regular ward environment. 
The frequency band of the models covers the range from _MATH_ GHz to _MATH_ GHz. 
In both on-body and on-body to off-body models, the channel impulse responses at CWC's measurements are more concentrated to shorter delays with stronger power gains. 
This is the most significant difference between these two models and its impact on the transceivers' performances can be seen from the simulation results as shown, for example, in _CITE_. 
In_REF_, the DS-UWB and UWB-FM systems' performance results are shown for the IEEE 802.15.4a and CWC's channels. 
In DS-UWB, coherent maximum ratio combining (MRC) and non-coherent square law combining (SLC) are used at the receiver. 
The number of rake fingers obtained in the DS-UWB is 1, 3 and 10. 
Correspondingly, the UWB-FM receiver is utilising different RF bandwidths. 
As can be seen, the channel models have great impact on the system performance. 
Both channel models used in the simulations are targeted to WBAN applications but still the UWB systems' performances are different. 
As a general rule, the system design is a trade off between targeted quality of service level and an implementation complexity. 
The system parameters used in the simulations are shown in_REF_ _CITE_.
Substituting _MATH_ in the above equations, we have _MATHDISP_ 
It is important to note that, under the current assumptions, the above dynamic system always converges to the optimal solution _MATH_. 
Consider System (_REF_) with _MATH_ strictly convex and differentiable. 
For any initial values of _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have _MATH_. 
The proof (_CITE_, _CITE_) links the global under-estimator property of the gradient of a convex function with dissipation. 
This view is consistent with that one emerged in the study of control of networks, _CITE_-_CITE_.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, the mathematic model of TSP is described. 
In Section 3, an overview of the chaotic ant swarm is presented. 
In Section 4, we present how to apply the CAS to TSP in detail. 
Computational results are presented and analyzed in section 5 while in the last section conclusion and future research are given.
Figure _REF_ plots the runtimes of both Algorithm _REF_ and _REF_ for signals containing 8 nonzero frequencies hidden in various bandwidths. 
Looking at Figure _REF_ we can see that Algorithm _REF_ is faster than Algorithm _REF_ for all bandwidth values greater than 128. 
Likewise, Algorithm _REF_ is faster than FFTW for all bandwidth values greater than _MATH_. 
More generally, Algorithm _REF_ will be faster than FFTW for all highly-sparse wideband signals.
However, the exponential explosion of video data combined with the user participatory model of the Web 2.0 created a large fraction of duplicated or near-duplicated videos in the Web. 
Duplicated videos bring problems to both users and content producers. 
Several aspects of the Web are affected by the growing presence of duplicated content, such as copyright enforcement, video clustering, recommendation, annotation propagation, multimedia authoring and video search. 
Most video search engines rely exclusively on text keywords or user-supplied tags to select video content. 
As a result, a typical search on a popular topic often returns many duplicated and near-duplicated videos in the top results. 
Figure _REF_ shows three identical results in terms of the video content for a search on YouTube using the query "Susan Boyle". 
We can see that not only these videos have differences in terms of the metadata associated to them, but they also present different statistics that indicate popularity. 
In fact, Cha et al _CITE_ pointed out that duplicated videos can negatively impact performance of caching mechanisms and content distribution networks (CDN's).
Formulation of the integral equation. 
In this section, we determine the detailed behavior of solution s for which _MATH_ approaches _MATH_ as _MATH_ where _MATH_ is an integer. 
We shall show that the initial condition s for such solution s lie on curves forming the boundaries of the basins of attraction for solution s _MATH_ approaching _MATH_. 
Some of the notations used in this section differ from those used in Section _REF_.
We set _MATHDISP_, so that _REF_ is equivalent to _MATHDISP_. 
We imitate the approach of Section _REF_: Set _MATHDISP_, so that _REF_ becomes _MATHDISP_. 
This _MATH_ differs slightly from that of the _MATH_ of Section _REF_, while _REF_ differs critically from _REF_ by virtue of the change of sign in front of _MATH_. 
We assume that _MATH_ has the properties given in _REF_.
We give a global description of the branches of positive solutions of first-order impulsive boundary value problem _MATHDISP_, which is not necessarily linearizable. 
Where _MATH_ is a parameter, _MATH_ are given impulsive points. 
Our approach is based on Krein-Rutman theorem, topological degree and global bifurcation techniques.
Going any further requires a specific model for this particle, and one model typically explored is that of a right-handed sterile neutrino, which can decay into a left-handed standard model neutrino and photons; these photons give then a background, and for each galaxy a specific emission line at a photon energy at half the mass of the particle. 
Such models can be compared with data and then suggest, that such a particle is actually sub-thermal (Kusenko 2005, 2006, 2009, Biermann &amp; Kusenko 2006, Loewenstein &amp; Kusenko 2010), and so our equations need to be modified; however the principal route remains, and for each specific model this can be worked out (see Boyanovsky et al. 2008a, 2008b, de Vega &amp; Sanchez 2010, 2011, de Vega et al. 2011). 
This suggests in the end a somewhat higher mass, a few keV. 
There are some speculations now how such particles could naturally arise (Kusenko et al. 2010, and Bezrukov et al. 2010).
Computing _MATH_ requires 2 rounds (one from _MATH_ to send the obfuscated ciphertexts and one from _MATH_ to send back the result) and a bandwidth of _MATH_ bits (3 ciphertexts are exchanged having size _MATH_ bits, where _MATH_ is the Paillier security parameter introduced in _REF_) with a computational complexity equal to: _MATH_ to encrypt the obfuscation values _MATH_, _MATH_ needed to compute _MATH_ and _MATH_; _MATH_ needed to obfuscate _MATH_, _MATH_ and to compute the additions to _MATH_; _MATH_ to obtain in plain _MATH_ and _MATH_ and finally _MATH_ to encrypt the result, for an asymptotic complexity of _MATH_ operations.
A mathematical formulation of Bell's local realism may be given by relation (in more details it is discussed in the next section) _MATHDISP_ Here _MATH_ and _MATH_ are self-adjoint operators which commute on a natural domain and _MATH_ and _MATH_ are certain indices. 
Here _MATH_ is a mathematical expectation and _MATH_ and _MATH_ are two stochastic processes and _MATH_ is a vector from a Hilbert space. 
Then we say that the triplet _MATHDISP_ satisfies the Bell^s local realism (BLR) condition.
We say that two terms _MATH_ are equivalent (or equal), denoted by _MATH_, if for all assignments _MATH_. 
Let us consider an example for terms of the _MATH_ algebra of this Definition _REF_: Let us consider the term _MATH_ of the _MATH_-algebra, equal to the algebraic expression _MATH_, which is represented by the tree above, with the four different paths that ends with leafs which are equal to relational tables.
Let's see more precisely how to copy the first three bits of _MATH_, namely 110, into the machine condition region. 
Starting on the leftmost _MATH_ with state _MATH_, the machine copies 110 one symbol at a time repeatedly as follows: shift to the right until _MATH_ reads for the first time some 0 or 1; memorize the symbol just read and replace the symbol with _MATH_ or _MATH_ (_MATH_ or _MATH_); shift to the left until _MATH_ reads the leftmost _MATH_ (_MATH_ or _MATH_); shift to the right until _MATH_ reads for the first time some 0 or 1 and write on the square the symbol memorized with _MATH_ or _MATH_ (_MATH_ or _MATH_); shift to the right until _MATH_ reads the first _MATH_ to prepare for the next cycle (_MATH_). 
Figure _REF_ shows the tape contents at the time when the first two bits of _MATH_ has been copied as _MATH_ on the leftmost squares between _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
When starting at the configuration of Figure _REF_ with _MATH_, the machine repeats the cycle three times, the content on the leftmost five squares becomes _MATH_. 
Then the machine remembers the fourth bit 1 of _MATH_ by going from _MATH_ to _MATH_ and moves to the leftmost _MATH_ and then search for 0 or 1 encountered for the first time going rightward. 
But this time before the machine encounters 0 or 1 it reads _MATH_ and does transition _MATH_, thereby proceeding to 3.
In this paper, Let _MATH_ be a Euclidean Space with the inner product _MATH_ and corresponding norm _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Vector norm _MATH_ induced matrix norm _MATH_, for _MATH_, where _MATH_ denotes the maximum eigenvalue of _MATH_. 
_MATH_ denotes the minimum eigenvalue of _MATH_.
The _MATH_ are both random and known quantities which influence the process according to the weights given by the (non-random and unknown) function _MATH_. 
They play the same role as the covariables in the one-dimensional case.
A natural way to characterize the regularization network between a set of SNVs and a set of expressions is through multivariate regression models in which the expression levels are responses and the SNVs are predictors. 
However, both the number of responses and the number of predictors can be larger than the sample size. 
Moreover, the predictors are often highly correlated due to natural grouping structures (e.g., genes or linkage disequilibrium blocks) for SNVs. 
These challenges complicate the already difficult problem of model selection and parameter estimation in high dimensional data.
Three new times of light minima are obtained from our CCD photometric observations with the PI1024 TKB CCD photometric system attached to the 1.0-m reflecting telescope at the Yunnan Observatory in China. 
The first two CCD photometric observations of _REF_ were carried out on January 2 and 4, 2008, respectively, mostly through R-filter, which is close to the Johnson's standard photometric system, but the final observations on April 2, 2008 were in white light. 
All images were reduced by using PHOT (measure magnitudes for a list of stars) of the aperture photometry package of IRAF. 
Three new CCD times of light minima were derived by using a parabolic fitting method, and three new light curves are displayed in Fig. 1.
We start with the theory describing the motion of the open bosonic string in the background created by the closed string modes _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In our previous papers _CITE_ and _CITE_, we treated the Neumann boundary conditions as constraints and used the Dirac prescription. 
In the present paper we show that supposing the appropriate form of the solution, its explicit final expression may be obtained in a much simpler way. 
On this solution of boundary condition, we obtain the effective theory. 
The effective background fields are the background fields seen by the effective string. 
In the previously investigated cases, of the flat background (_MATH_ and _MATH_) and the weakly curved one without constant term of Kalb-Ramond field (_MATH_ and _MATH_ _CITE_) the effective metric is constant and the effective Kalb-Ramond field is zero.
In this case, the loop and update operations are written correctly but the number of elements is fixed to 10. 
The programmer may be sure that the number of elements in input vectors to be considered and handled via this program is always 10. 
But, why not to make it more general without too much effort?
We note that the functionality requirement from _REF_ is significantly weaker than perfect functionality or the approximate functionality by _CITE_. 
For completeness we include a discussion involving the latter in _REF_.
The point star unfolding cuts the shortest paths from _MATH_ to every vertex of _MATH_. 
The idea goes back to Alexandrov _CITE_; that it unfolds _MATH_ to a simple (non-overlapping) polygon was established in _CITE_.
Consequently, the next generation population sizes _MATH_ and _MATH_ before dispersal are calculated from Eq. (_REF_) and (_REF_) by: _MATHDISP_.
In general if _MATH_ is _MATH_ then along row _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, and along column _MATH_, _MATHDISP_.
The organization of this paper is as follows. 
In Section 2 we review stack filters and their threshold decomposition property, and define the stack filtering operators and the generalized deviation between of a discrete bi-valued input signal and its output signal of these stack filtering operators. 
In Section 3 we prove the optimality of the median filtering operator under the minimal generalized deviation. 
In Section 4 we give some properties of the median filtering operator and some methods for the better use of the filtering operator.
Stateful systems can also be associated with "coherent caching," in which the client system can cache data with confidence that the cached copy won't become stale. 
As we will see, this problem is solvable, although necessary mechanisms are rarely available to developers. 
The issue turns out to reflect a tradeoff between performance and properties. 
It is clear that a client system with a coherently cached data item will obtain performance benefits by being able to perform actions correctly using local data (hence, avoiding a round-trip delay over the network) and may therefore be able to guarantee some form of real-time response to the application. 
However, the system as a whole will see reduced performance because locking and other forms of synchronization are typically conservative, preventing some actions even when they would have been legal. 
Moreover, the associated mechanisms make the underlying platform more complex. 
Platform developers have apparently concluded that most users value higher performance more than they value strong guarantees and hence have opted for a simpler, faster architecture.
Lemma 3.3. 
Let _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be fixed. 
Then, we have for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_
Consider a hook involution _MATH_ as above and denote by _MATH_ the underlying involution. 
If _MATH_ is a transposition in _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the height of the corresponding hook, then by the preceding lemma we can define a cycle _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ is a fixed point of _MATH_, then _MATH_ must be odd by definition of _MATH_, and thanks to the lemma we can in this case define a cycle _MATH_. 
Now all these cycles _MATH_, over all indices _MATH_, are pairwise disjoint: their product is the desired root _MATH_ of _MATH_.
In the case of a 3-D piston, the expanding driver pushes the plasma in all directions as in, e.g., a supernova explosion. 
The one-dimensional analog is a piston in a tube, where the gas ahead of the piston cannot be transposed to behind the piston. 
In such a case the shock can be formed even if the piston is "subsonic" (e.g., see Problem 1 in S 101 in Landau and Lifshitz, _CITE_). 
The offset distance between the shock and the piston always increases in time, i.e., the shock is faster than the piston. 
Shocks of this kind are called piston-shocks. 
A special case of the piston-shock is the situation where the wave is driven only temporarily, i.e., after the acceleration phase the piston starts decelerating and stops after certain time. 
The outcome is a freely-propagating shocked simple-wave.
According to _CITE_, this example demonstrates the usefulness of the combination of intensity data and sparse depth data obtained from a camera moving in an uncontrolled manner, regarding a surface with well-defined reflectance properties under accurately known illumination conditions. 
The self-consistent solution for the three-dimensional surface profile obtained according to Section _REF_ yields a crater rim of largely uniform height, indicating that the estimated surface gradients in the horizontal and in the vertical image direction are essentially correct. 
In contrast, surface reconstruction by shape from shading alone based on images acquired under identical illumination conditions is not able to simultaneously estimate both surface gradients for each pixel as long as no boundary values are known for the surface to be reconstructed. 
What is more, the sparse depth points do not introduce spurious artifacts into the reconstructed surface profile despite the considerable noise in the three-dimensional point cloud (cf. Fig. _REF_c) extracted by structure from motion.
2. if _MATH_ is a term and _MATH_ a unary operator then _MATH_ is a term.
To study the behaviour of the CA-model, five synthetic experiments are performed (see table _REF_ for a short overview of the experiments). 
In all these experiments, the subsurface is divided into _MATH_ by _MATH_ cells. 
Using a standard simulation technique, a fraction _MATH_ of all cells is assigned lithology 0. 
The parameter _MATH_ is varied between _MATH_ and _MATH_ with steps of _MATH_. 
The one-sided transition probabilities _MATH_, with _MATH_ are prescribed and chosen to be identical for both sediment types. 
In every experiment the one-sided transition probabilities and the fraction _MATH_ are varied. 
For every parameter setting 250 realisations are made to get information about the mean and standard deviation of the cycle length, the number of iterations necessary to reach the final solution, the fraction of the two lithologies and the fraction of cells that changes within the periodic attractor. 
For every realisation one can choose to either start with a new initial condition, or determine new CA-rules, or do both.
Even if these results are proved in _CITE_, let us resume their proofs here, in order to better understand the following ones.
System (_REF_) under hypotheses (L1-3), (L5) and (G) satisfies the WIOS property if and only if the "unforced" system _MATHDISP_ is RGAOS.
For the case of polynomial time reducibility, suppose that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are computed by Turing machines _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_ steps, respectively, where _MATH_ is the length of input _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are integers. 
Then, since the length of an output is obviously upper bounded by the steps of _MATH_, we have _MATH_. 
Therefore, the steps of _MATH_ is upper bounded by _MATH_. 
Thus _MATH_ computes the reduction _MATH_ in at most _MATH_ steps, hence in polynomial time. 
This completes the proof. 
The limiter's motion have been typically assumed in form _MATH_ _CITE_. 
This choice leads to serious difficulties in solving Eq. (_REF_) for _MATH_ thus making analytical investigations of dynamics hardly possible. 
Accordingly, we have decided to simplify the limiter's periodic motion to make Eq. (_REF_) solvable. 
Very recently we have adopted a very simple motion of the table with piecewise constant velocity _MATH_mod1 and we have performed numerical and analytical computations _CITE_. 
This motion of the table implies that while the table moves up with a constant velocity, it goes down infinitely fast and hence the model is not fully physical. 
Moreover, the dynamics of this model is relatively simple and corresponds only partially to the dynamics of the model with periodic motion of the table _CITE_. 
It follows that the analytical results obtained in _CITE_ cannot illuminate very complex dynamics of the standard model with periodic motion of the limiter. 
Therefore we decided to investigate dynamics of a ball with a more realistic motion of the table in the present paper (a preliminary report has been published in the conference proceedings _CITE_).
The group of semantically related models refers to methodologies whose mapping between design and performance models is based on the analysis of the dynamic behavior of the design artifacts. 
For example, in M4 the mapping is based on the analysis of the state machines model of the system design.
The effect of _MATH_ on the channel bandwidth and the system performance is analyzed through a series of simulations. 
The impact of different values of _MATH_ on the bandwidth consumption is summarized in the Table _REF_. 
It can been seen that the bandwidth utilization is reduced as _MATH_ is increased, however with _MATH_, the system becomes unstable. 
It shows that there is always a trade off between the system performance and the bandwidth utilization. 
This can be verified by analyzing the _MATH_ performance with different values of the _MATH_. 
It is shown in Figure _REF_ that by increasing the _MATH_, magnitude of _MATH_ is increasing which stands for the degradation in the _MATH_ performance.
As for each solar cycle the sign of leading sunspots in each of the Sun's hemispheres is known, it is possible to evaluate the imbalance of magnetic fluxes for the leading sunspots only. 
For example, for Solar Cycle 21 leading sunspots in the northern hemisphere have positive polarity [_MATH_], whereas leading sunspots of the southern hemisphere have negative sign [_MATH_]. 
Then the difference [_MATH_] will represent the imbalance of magnetic flux of leading sunspots during Cycle 21. 
An analogous approach can be used for other solar cycles. 
The resultant imbalance of the leading sunspot fluxes is shown in Figure _REF_.
Since the introduction by _CITE_, intervention analysis has been a standard methodology for assessing the effect of an intervention on the mean of a time series in many fields including ecology _CITE_. 
Nevertheless, intervention analysis has not been used widely with spatio-temporal data, especially in ecological studies, even though such data characterize a discipline that seeks to understand the distribution of abundance of species _CITE_. 
Part of the reason might be that spatio-temporal data often span a much shorter length in time than does a typical time series, and large scale interventions are rare. 
A special application concerns the effect of river monitoring networks on water quality in a spatio-temporal model _CITE_, where traditional spatio-temporal models are not appropriate because of downstream directional spatial dependence. 
We incorporate intervention effects of hurricanes into a traditional spatio-temporal model for abundance of N. tridens. 
In particular, the count _MATH_ at site _MATH_ and year _MATH_ is assumed to be Poisson with mean _MATH_, which, after logarithmic transformation, comprises three parts: overall level, hurricane effects over time, and spatio-temporal noise. 
Our statistical inferences are performed in a Bayesian framework.
We first give the proof under the simplifying assumptions that all puzzles are non-ambiguous (i.e., a puzzle _MATH_ uniquely determines the random tape _MATH_ that generated _MATH_), and that we can test if a given _MATH_-tuple of puzzle instances _MATH_ is such that _MATH_ makes fewer than _MATH_ mistakes. 
Later we remove these assumptions.
Consider a control system _MATH_ satisfying Hypothesis (G1) and the WIOS property from the input _MATH_ with weight _MATH_ and gain _MATH_. 
Consider _MATH_, where _MATH_, the control system which results from the feedback interconnection of system _MATH_ with a static map _MATH_ that satisfies (_REF_) for certain constant _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is RGAOS.
In recent years, a variety of material sets have been proposed as alternative plasmonic materials including doped semiconductors _CITE_, intermetallics _CITE_, transparent conducting oxides _CITE_, transition metal nitrides _CITE_, and graphene _CITE_. 
One material set in particular, Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs), have shown significant tunability across the near-infrared spectrum by varying the concentration of oxygen vacancies and interstitial metal dopants introduced into the films during deposition. 
These materials, including aluminum zinc oxide, indium zinc oxide, and indium tin oxide have primarily been used as components in touch screen displays; however, their low losses (five times smaller than silver) _CITE_, tunability, and compatibility with standard fabrication processes have resulted in increasing attention from the plasmonics and metamaterials communities. 
From a design and optimization standpoint, they offer another interesting benefit. 
From Section _REF_ we know that the Drude dielectric constant is given by: _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
Let _MATH_ be the following system of homogeneous equations (conjectured in _CITE_ to be an efficient initial pair for homotopy methods): _MATHDISP_. 
Observe that _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ has a trivial solution _MATH_. 
In _CITE_ we have bounded the number _MATH_ of steps of projective Newton's method sufficient to follow a homotopy _MATH_ in the solution variety _MATH_ by the length of the path _MATH_ in the condition metric, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, and _MATH_ is as in _CITE_. 
Namely, _MATHDISP_. 
Then, _MATH_ for some universal constant _MATH_. 
In this paper we find a short path joining any two pairs in _MATH_. 
Namely, we prove the following result. 
For every pair _MATH_ such that _MATH_, there exists a curve _MATH_ joining _MATH_ and _MATH_, and such that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a universal constant. 
For every two pairs _MATH_ such that _MATH_, there exists a curve _MATH_ joining _MATH_ and _MATH_, and such that _MATHDISP_. 
A sufficient number of projective Newton steps to follow some path in _MATH_ starting at _MATH_ to find an approximate zero associated to a solution _MATH_ of a given system _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a universal constant. 
The real case (i.e. the study of real solutions to real systems of equations) can be analyzed with similar techniques. 
In this case, the subset of _MATH_ where _MATH_ is finite (denoted _MATH_ or _MATH_ later in this manuscript) may have 1 or 2 connected components, depending on _MATH_. 
Then, in each of these connected components, corollaries _REF_ and _REF_ hold, with the orthogonal group replacing the unitary group. 
This observation was also pointed out to us by _CITE_.
The factor _MATH_ reflects that the numbering of the states starts at 1, but the kinetic energy of the lowest excited state is 0 eV. 
As is the case for the electron-lattice scattering rate, the electron-electron rate will also be discussed in relation to the new measurements described in Sec. _REF_ below.
Note that ambit processes may provide a statistical approach to model physical processes in nature far simpler than SPDEs, since they provide a way to specify directly the model based on a probabilistic understanding of the phenomena in question. 
They also give a framework for extending the solutions of SPDEs. 
In order to have a solution in the sense of Walsh, often strong integrability conditions are imposed. 
The ambit processes are well-defined under very weak conditions of integrability, and thereby we may extend the solutions of certain equations to include far more general initial conditions, say, or more general types of noise.
With the simplification by setting _MATH_ and _MATH_ in Eq.(_REF_), we have the following expression for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ represent quadratical divergent, logarithmical divergent, and regular part in the _MATH_.
In _CITE_ the time-dependent power transfer function _MATH_ is expressed as: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ represents the mean channel gain, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ the slow and fast fading components. 
The slow component is basically due to the shadowing by the body, which mainly depends on its movements, as shown in_REF_. 
When the subject does not move the slow component is very moderate, since the shadowing condition basically remains unchanged. 
However, the mean channel gain values vary significantly from one subject to another. 
This is due to morphological differences of subjects and to the proprieties of their tissues, even if antenna positioning on each subject is carefully reproduced. 
The most appropriate model for _MATH_ is found from measurements to be lognormal: _MATHDISP_ where the mean value and standard deviation depend on the scenario _MATH_ (representing a given on-body radio link, movement and environment) as described above _CITE_. 
The statistical analysis of _MATH_ is performed on the mean channel gain of different subjects, so that the normal distribution accounts for the dissimilarities between human bodies. 
Some local micro-variations of the antenna emplacement due to dissimilar morphologies, produce also differences in the mean channel gain, and their effect is taken into account by Eq. _REF_.
We shall use the existence and uniqueness of Whittaker models for _MATH_ and for each of the local representations _MATH_ (see _CITE_ section 3.5). 
For each place _MATH_, let _MATH_ denote the Whittaker space, corresponding to _MATH_ and the additive character _MATH_ introduced at the beginning of this section. 
For each place _MATH_ such that _MATH_ contains a _MATH_-fixed vector, the space of _MATH_-fixed vectors is one dimensional (see _CITE_ Theorems 2.4.2 , 4.6.2), and contains a unique element which takes the value 1 on all of _MATH_ (the existence of such an element in the non-archimedean case is proved in _CITE_, Proposition 3.5.2; existence in the Archimedean case can be proved along the same lines but we do not need it here).
To study the existence of solutions for the BSDEs(_MATH_) of type (_REF_), we assume in all the sequel the boundedness of the terminal condition _MATH_. 
Moreover, we suppose that there exists a non-negative predictable process _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for a strictly positive constant _MATH_, and such that with three strictly positive constants _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, one of the three following conditions hold: _MATHDISP_. 
We give here some comments: _MATH_ Assumption _MATH_ is more general than the other two but we only require these two last assumptions to establish the existence result. 
We first reduce the assumption (_MATH_) to (_MATH_) by a classical truncation procedure, and we note that the additional assumption in _MATH_ is that the lower bound has at most linear growth in _MATH_. 
This condition has already been used by _CITE_ in the Brownian setting to justify the existence of a minimal solution. 
We rely on the same construction to prove our existence result.
The local approximation means that _MATH_ and the validity of the vertical integrated equation requires _MATH_ where _MATH_ is the perturbation wave number defined by _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the perturbation wavelength. 
Since _MATH_ then we have _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, for a geometrically thin disk _MATH_ set between 1 to _MATH_. 
However, for a geometrically slim disk, in which _MATH_, range of _MATH_ is between _MATH_ to 1 if _MATH_ is about _MATH_. 
In addition, the validity of vertical integrated equation requires that the growth rates of unstable modes are less than the angular velocity (Kato et.al. 1996). 
In this paper, we restrict our discussion on these cases.
The jobs _MATH_ will form all the non-full batches in the following dynamic programming algorithm. 
It is easy to show that those non-full batches are sequenced in increasing order of processing times in any optimal schedule. 
Therefore we assume that the remaining jobs are re-indexed according to the SPT rule. 
Let _MATH_ be the processing time of _MATH_ for _MATH_.
The state equation _REF_ has a unique strong solution on the filtered probability space _MATH_ for any _MATH_-adapted process _MATH_ (see e.g. Problem 6.15 in _CITE_). 
Denoting its value at time _MATH_ by _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover this solution belongs to the class _MATH_ of progressively measurable _MATH_-mean continuous processes for every _MATH_ (see e.g. _CITE_, Theorem 6.16).
Now, we suppose _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We will deduce a generating function for the polynomials _MATH_ starting from relation _REF_. 
First, we need a generating function for the polynomials _MATH_.
To further explore the translation invariance of the derived kernel, we subjected the labeled and unlabeled sets of images to translations ranging from 0 to 10 pixels in one of 8 randomly chosen directions. 
Figure _REF_ gives classification accuracies for each of the image translations in the case of 3- and 2-layer derived kernels as well as for the _MATH_ baseline. 
As would be expected, the derived kernels are better able to accommodate image translations than _MATH_ on the whole, and classification accuracy decays more gracefully in the derived kernel cases as we increase the size of the translation. 
In addition, the 3-layer derived kernel is seen to generally outperform the 2-layer derived kernel for translations up to approximately 20% of the field of view. 
For very large translations, however, a single layer remains more robust than the particular 2-layer architecture we have simulated. 
We suspect that this is because large translations cause portions of the digits to be clipped off the edge of the image, whereas templates used by two-layer architectures describe nearly all regions of a class of digits. 
Lack of a digit part could thus undermine the descriptive advantage of the 3-layer architecture over the 2-layer hierarchy.
Since the algorithm continues until there are no more edges left, every edge is covered, therefore the output from _MATH_ is a MVC, taking _MATH_ time. 
The set of edges picked by this algorithm is a matching as edges chosen are disjoint and it is maximal as addition of another edge is not possible. 
Since two vertices are covered for each matched edge, the approximation ratio for this algorithm is 2. 
Comparison of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The convexity condition (_REF_) now reduces to the version of (_REF_) _MATHDISP_ for freely independent _MATH_ and _MATH_, where _MATH_ is Rademacher and _MATH_ is positive. 
Obviously, (_REF_) implies _MATHDISP_ Assume that _MATH_, _MATH_ are freely independent, _MATH_ are non-negative and _MATH_ are Rademacher variables. 
Then, comparison (_REF_) holds for _MATH_ and _MATH_, for all freely independent _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATH_, for some _MATH_. 
In particular, (_REF_) holds for _MATH_. 
Notice that _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_ 
The comparison (_REF_) does not hold for _MATH_. 
We first notice that, for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_ which can be negative. 
The last one follows from the extremality approach by choosing operators _MATH_ in such a way that _MATH_ with _MATH_ being two point variable, i.e. _MATH_ (A similar argument was applied in Lefevre and Utev (2003)). 
An alternative approach is to analyze comparison (_REF_) for special processes such as conditionally free random variables and make use of specific probability representations (see, e.g. Bryc and Wesolowski (2007) and references therein).
We assessed the association between gene methylation levels in the asthma pathway and air pollution, controlling for age. 
We first partialled out the covariate age, then standardized all the covariates to have mean 0 and variance 1, and finally applied step-CCA, SOS-CCA and PMA-CCA to the methylation scores for the 27 genes in the asthma pathway and the exposure variables: measured Black Carbon ( bc) and Sulfate ( sulfate), calculated by averaging over the daily measures in the month prior to a participant's clinic visit. 
The pairwise correlations of the genes in the pathway were generally low, with most of them less than 0.2 and some close to 0.5, suggesting that the marginal method SOS-CCA is likely to perform better than step-CCA, and can be slightly better than PMA-CCA. 
Figure _REF_ presents a clustered heatmap of the correlations between the genes in the pathway.
the velocities of the equatorward meridional flow are 6.9, 5.7, and 5.3 m s_MATH_ in the northern hemisphere and 7.2, 6.1, and 7.2 m s_MATH_ in the southern hemisphere at the mean anchor depths of (_MATH_) 0.87, 0.85, and 0.82 respectively from Kodaikanal data (Table _REF_).
We use the standard Darmois-Israel formalism _CITE_ to analyze the dynamics of the wormhole. 
The two sides of the shell are matched through the extrinsic curvature defined on _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ are the coordinates on _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the unit normals obtained to _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_, satisfying the relation _MATH_. 
The induced metric on _MATH_ is defined as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a the proper time on the hypersurface. 
The non-vanishing components of the extrinsic curvature turns out to be _MATHDISP_. 
Here dot and prime mean derivative with respect to _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively.
In the case of an open-ended chain of nearest neighbors coupled non-identical oscillators, the chain's dynamics is given by the following set of equations: _MATHDISP_. 
Our choice of considering non-identical coefficients is justified by the parameter spread encountered in real systems, as discussed in Sect. IV for the ring of nearest neighbors coupled nonidentical self-sustained oscillators. 
The set of equations (_REF_) is numerically integrated to compute the Kuramoto order parameter _MATH_, Eq. (_REF_), versus the coupling coefficient _MATH_, to quantify the fraction of synchronized oscillators dynamics in the chain of open-ended nearest neighbors coupled non-identical oscillators.
In this section, performance characteristics of ROMs of the lid-driven cavity derived using the standard POD-Galerkin MOR approach are summarized. 
In the standard POD-Galerkin MOR approach, _MATH_ order ROMs are derived by projecting the residual of the Navier Stokes onto the first _MATH_ most energetic POD spatial basis functions, _MATH_. 
In this paper, the generated ROMs are integrated in MATLAB using the built-in adaptive forth/fifth order Runge-Kutta scheme (ODE45). 
Figure _REF_ summarizes the stability characteristics of the standard POD-Galerkin ROMs by the turbulent kinetic energy. 
The turbulent kinetic energy, _MATH_ as predicted by the DNS of the lid-driven cavity is identified by the thick grey curves. 
The optimal reconstruction of the turbulent kinetic energy given the first _MATH_ POD basis functions, _MATH_ is identified by the thin black curves. 
Finally, the turbulent kinetic energy, _MATH_ as predicted by ROMs derived using the standard POD-Galerkin MOR approach is identified by the thin blue curves. 
The turbulent kinetic energy of the ROM is calculated using Eq. _REF_ using temporal basis functions _MATH_ derived from the numerical integration of Eq. _REF_. 
Figure. _REF_ illustrates several characteristic properties of low-order ROMs derived using the standard POD-Galerkin MOR approach. 
First, as the number of POD basis functions is increased, the optimal kinetic energy reconstruction (thin black curves) converges to the true kinetic energy of the DNS (thick gray curves) as the number of basis functions _MATH_ is increased. 
Second, despite the fact that the POD basis functions are capable of reconstructing the flow very accurately, i.e the black curves are very close to the thick gray curves, this accuracy is not inherited by the ROMs generated from these basis functions. 
In order to generate accurate and stable ROMs using the standard POD-Galerkin MOR approach significantly more POD basis functions are required.
Oscillations of the values of flow and cost are observed both with the small network of non-separable costs and with theArea Maggi network. 
They are due to two different aspects. 
The first is related to the mechanism of non separable costs; the cost of a link might depend on two (or more) link flows at the same time and therefore the network is more sensitive to changes. 
The second is related to the structure of the network: when a network has many isolated nodes, it is scarcely connected (in the sense that the number of links is close to the number of nodes) and this creates some problems to ants in exploring alternative paths. 
TheArea Maggi network is also sensitive to _MATH_, although to a minor extent than non-separable costs network: in this network the many _MATH_ pairs constrained on a limited number of links contribute to slow down the algorithm convergence.
In _CITE_, Collins considered traversals of _MATH_, for _MATH_, and showed that for _MATH_, an upper bound _MATH_ can be obtained by a hybrid path spiraling in each horizontal plane until the size of each link gets down to _MATH_ and then switching to vertical mode. 
He conjectured that these paths are optimal. 
Using our tight bound for traversing the cube (Theorem _REF_) we can easily confirm this fact (modulo a linear term): it follows from the equality _MATH_ (or even directly, with no calculation). 
Embed the box _MATH_ into the cube _MATH_ and assume that there is a better way to traverse the box. 
Then using a hybrid path spiraling in each horizontal plane until the size of each link gets down to _MATH_ and then continuing with the supposedly better path for the box _MATH_, one would get a path traversing the cube having fewer than _MATH_ links (modulo a linear term), which is a contradiction.
(G1) There exist functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Without loss of generality, we may assume that the gain function _MATH_ is of class _MATH_. 
Next consider an interconnected system comprised of _MATH_ and a static map _MATH_ that satisfies _MATHDISP_ for some constant _MATH_. 
We denote by _MATH_, where _MATH_, the control system which results from the feedback interconnection of system _MATH_ with the static map _MATH_. 
Notice that here it is implied that the static map _MATH_ satisfies (_REF_) as well as additional requirements so that the feedback interconnection is well defined (in the sense explained in Chapter 1).
Condition _REF_ is equivalent to requiring that the graph associated to the "fast system" - which, incidentally, has the adjacency matrix _MATH_ - is acyclic.
Proposal distributions for the MH step were normal where the mean was the current value of the parameter and the standard deviation was parameter-specific. 
The RJ and MH step together completed one iteration. 
A total of 100 000 iterations were carried out where the first 10 000 were considered the burn-in period and ignored when obtaining model probabilities and summary statistics for parameters. 
Visual inspection of raw trace plots from different starting points for parameters suggested that convergence had been achieved within 10 000 iterations.
Again by the fixed point equation _REF_ we find _MATHDISP_. 
Multiplying by _MATH_ and taking the supremum over _MATH_ then proves _REF_. 
This completes the proof. 
Instead of the Volterra operator _MATH_ defined in _REF_ we could have used parametric Volterra operators _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, i.e., considering the situation for every fixed instance of parameters _MATH_. 
Then the existence result follows by essentially the same arguments (dropping the supremum over _MATH_ everywhere). 
The estimate _REF_ can be derived in exactly the same way, and then the choice of the product topology on _MATH_, Assumption _REF_ and assuming continuity of _MATH_ proves continuity of _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
Together with the continuity of _MATH_ and _REF_ we further obtain _MATH_. 
Finally, we obtain the following a priori estimates.
Now let us consider the joint limits in Table _REF_ and the drift-free criterion as well. 
Specifically, the DNN, with _MATH_ and _MATH_ in (_REF_) and _MATH_ in (_REF_), is applied to PA10 for the same circular-path tracking task. 
Figure _REF_ shows the 3-dimensional motion trajectories of the PA10 manipulator and the corresponding joint angles. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates the transient behaviors of the DNN and the PA10 manipulator, including the profiles of dual decision vector _MATH_, the PA10 joint velocity _MATH_, Cartesian position error _MATH_ and velocity error _MATH_. 
More specifically, as seen in Fig. _REF_, the joint angle _MATH_ now never exceeds the mechanical range [_MATH_,_MATH_], and the solution is repetitive in the sense that the initial state and final state of the PA10 manipulator coincide with each other. 
It follows from Fig. _REF_ that no joint-velocity variable exceeds its limits in Table _REF_. 
In addition, the maximal position and velocity errors are less than _MATH_ m and _MATH_ m/s, respectively.
Remark 3.1. 
Let _MATH_, where _MATH_ are real-valued positive functions and. 
Then the Condition 3.1 is satisfied.
Second, a nonlinear factor _MATH_ should be small. 
Under this condition, damping laws (_REF_) are derived and this very condition ensures a correct calculation of the terms involving _MATH_ in ray equations system (_REF_). 
With respect to the limitations of laws (_REF_), the point-like atmospheric explosion theory _CITE_ suggests that these laws describe satisfactorily spherical shock wave propagation up to _MATH_. 
When we choose the initial value _MATH_ in Section _REF_, we do not therefore go beyond the scope of the application of relations (_REF_). 
However, ray equations (_REF_) and equations (_REF_) at _MATH_ are able to yield an error in calculations. 
Nevertheless, this error is insignificant due to the nearly spherical shape of the wave front at the initial phase of propagation and then it disappears owing to rapid decrease in _MATH_.
When the state and the action spaces are both finite, the so-called average reward optimality equations and the methods to determine optimal stationary policies have been investigated by Howard (1960) _CITE_, Lembersky (1974) _CITE_, Miller (1968) _CITE_, and many other authors. 
Here, in Sections _REF_-_REF_ we follow the approach by Guo, Song and Zhang (2009) _CITE_ and Zhang and Cao (2009) _CITE_, whose proofs are direct and simple. 
Moreover, the approach is self-contained in the sense that it does not require results from other problems, for instance, from discount discrete-time or continuous-time MDPs.
The key to resolving the calculational obstacle represented by the non-local term of (_REF_) was provided by Zwanziger in a series of interrelated articles, _CITE_. 
By considering the properties of the Gribov region in the Landau gauge the non-local Lagrangian was transformed into a local Lagrangian which involved extra spin-1 fields. 
These localizing ghosts, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, where the first pair are bosonic and the latter Grassmannian, are additional to the gauge potential and the Faddeev-Popov ghosts. 
Their presence does not alter the ultraviolet properties of the theory since, for instance, asymptotic freedom still holds in four dimensions. 
Instead they become effective in the infrared limit as one approaches the Gribov boundary. 
More specifically, the localized version of the Gribov Lagrangian is _CITE_ _MATHDISP_ where there is a mixed 2-point term involving the gluon. 
We have chosen to follow the current convention and use the real and imaginary parts of the Bose ghosts rather than the complex versions, _CITE_. 
This is because in four dimensions the behaviour of the propagators of each component is significantly different and is difficult to extract cleanly in the original _MATH_ and _MATH_ formulation. 
We take as the real and imaginary parts _MATHDISP_. 
(For comparison _MATH_ and _MATH_ are respectively the _MATH_ and _MATH_ fields of _CITE_.) 
Although we have omitted the _MATH_ dependent term since (_REF_) corresponds to the Landau gauge, one requires that term to safely derive all the propagators. 
As we will be considering the infrared properties of the one loop corrections to the transverse and longitudinal parts of the propagators, we record for completeness the form of the intermediate propagators prior to taking the _MATH_ _MATH_ 0 limit. 
These are _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ are the respective transverse and longitudinal projectors. 
Consequently, in our Landau gauge calculations we will use _MATHDISP_ as our propagators. 
The derivation of (_REF_) and (_REF_) is complicated by the mixed term of (_REF_) but was discussed at length in _CITE_. 
Though we note that for the real and imaginary Bose ghost there is a clean split of the propagators with the real part propagator having a similar form to that of the associated fermionic localizing ghost. 
When we examine the propagator corrections in the infrared this feature will be preserved in keeping with Zwanziger's recent general arguments, _CITE_.
In this respect, the presence of diurnal and seasonal modulations in the Pioneer data residues could be of particular interest. 
Anderson et al detected these modulations but argued that they could be due to modelling errors _CITE_. 
At the same time, such modulated anomalies are a natural output of some long range modifications of the gravity laws _CITE_. 
It is therefore important to analyze these time dependent signatures which can bring extra information with respect to the more extensively studied constant anomalous acceleration. 
For this purpose however, we have to face a difficulty associated with the fact that the trajectory reconstruction of Pioneer 10 and 11 probes has to rely only on the Doppler observable. 
No range information was available with the technology used for Pioneer 10 and 11, which entails that the position of the probe has to be extracted from the Doppler data. 
As a result, ambiguities may arise in the data reduction process when some modification in the physical model produces a change of the Doppler signal strongly correlated with that induced by a variation of the initial conditions.
To give the artists more control on the top of stylized rendering results, several techniques have been developed that modify the shape of the shading effect. 
The cartoon highlights of _CITE__CITE_ deal with shape transformation by dragging operations. 
The stylized highlight shape is adjusted via translation, rotation and scaling operators achieved using vector-field transforms. 
Ritschel et al. _CITE_ describe a shading deformation technique that is based on a virtual piece of cloth. 
By modifying sample points of the shading components, reflections and shadows can be dragged on the surface. 
Todo et al. _CITE_ and Pacanowski et al. _CITE_ give more direct control on the highlight shapes by providing intuitive painting methods. 
Although these methods allow additional flexibility to achieve the desired shape of the shading effects, the final shading appearance is limited to the specification of the stylized materials.
In _CITE_, Rajapakse et al. considered an approach based on Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and compared the face recognition results using color and gray scale images. 
On a test set of 100 face images, the authors have claimed a performance enhancement when using also color information for recognition.
A set of examples is examined to illustrate the features of the described formulation. 
In particular, the tests analyze plane and spatial kinematics by modeling the body with the presented two and three-dimensional elements.
The magnitude of the sensitivity clearly show a significant dip for smaller frequencies and smaller _MATH_ values.
The _MATH_ potentials _MATH_ are given by Chebyshev polynomials, of the first kind: _MATHDISP_ 
The explicit form of _MATH_, for _MATH_ and 5 with _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ which illustrate this new family of models. 
Here we note that, we have a diversity of sine-Gordon models, which includes variations of the sine-Gordon model, and the double sine-Gordon, triple sine-Gordon, and so on.
The three dimensional character of flamefronts and its effect on velocity measurements has been the subject of detailed past investigation. 
In particular the topic of optical flow velocimetry (OFV) technique has been critically examined in this context. 
Here one measures the correlation between (often diffuse) brightness features in sequentially acquired images to infer flow velocities. 
In a detailed study comparing OFV and PIV Fielding et al. _CITE_ found substantial deviations both between the directions of corresponding PIV and OFV flow vectors and also relative velocity differences. 
Whilst much of their discussion is relevant to the present paper there are important differences: 
In contrast to OFV we are not here tracking continuously varying and mostly diffusive scalar features to obtain gas phase velocity data. 
Indeed much of the error associated with OFV was found to stem simply from the difficulty in distinguishing diffusive image features as interrogation regions were decreased in size. 
The resulting correlation maps were much less conclusive than the corresponding, sharply peaked, correlation maps obtained from PIV (where discrete image objects are being tracked). 
In the present case we are merely tracking the sharply defined contour of the flame itself, which is clearly, and discretely separated in the two image frames. 
Systematic errors may however still arise in our case due to ambiguities in the method of connecting corresponding pixels on the convection line with those on flamefront 2 (_REF_). 
These ambiguities are small because of the small displacements we measure between the convection line and flame contour 2, and both contours are geometrically self similar over the time period investigated. 
Whilst the difficulty of merely "tracking" the flame contour is a much simpler problem than velocity tracking in OFV, the effects of large out-of-plane motion leads to similar problems in both cases. 
As discussed, in the theoretical section (see Sec. _REF_), convection of large scale structures into (and out of) the measurement plane causes an "artificial" flamefront displacement, of magnitude _MATH_ with _MATH_ defined as in Eq. _REF_ and Fig. _REF_ above. 
The quantity is negative or positive depending on whether the motion is into or out of the measurement plane. 
Thus for the case that _MATH_ _MATH_ this would merely introduce symmetrically distributed scatter on the evaluated _MATH_. 
Correlations between _MATH_ and _MATH_ revealed that this was indeed the case. 
Of course even if the convective components lie completely in the plane defined by the laser sheet, turbulent wrinkling could lead to the flamefront normal _MATH_ to be in a direction that points out of this plane. 
Effects of _MATH_ on _MATH_ will be investigated in more detail with Monte Carlo simulations in section _REF_.
For the present experiments, we fixed the window size experimentally. 
However, before deploying a production system, one would want to do a throughout experimental investigation to determine the optimal window size. 
Fortunately, the results are not highly sensitive to the window size selection, except to say that the window size must bear some relationship to the size of physical features on the ground, in particular, urban areas. 
The size of the typical city block and the width of city or residential streets, for instance entered our "calculations" when considering the issue.
Finally, we apply the mean of the transforms in each group to the whole image and apply SWT to re-detect texts in the transformed image. 
Since our transform matrix is parameterized by some parameters, such as scale, rotation angle, transition in x and y axis, the mean of the transforms is actually the mean of the parameters. 
Using those mean parameters, we generate the corresponding transform matrix. 
Some text re-detection results after image rectification are shown in Figure _REF_. 
Notice that all the rectified image are transform by the original input image because we have already calculated the corresponding transform parameter in the original input image, see (a) in figure _REF_ for example. 
We can see that the detection accuracies are significantly improved. 
This is partially because SWT relies heavily on the constant stroke width. 
However, in the original (distorted) image, stroke width can change significantly due to affine or perspective transform. 
Hence, rectification is crucial for enhancing SWT-based text detection.
Because we share the same hypotheses, we can use Thm. _REF_ to obtain _MATH_ and the corresponding negative principal minor. 
It is then possible to apply Thm. _REF_ to decompose that minor according to the DSR graph as a sum of terms for each species hamiltonian hooping equivalence class, and this sum must contain a negative term.
From the above description it may seem that the prospect of using state-based capabilities for automated matching is rather bleak when looking at our expectations concerning the description of preconditions and assumptions, especially from the side of the requester; if the formal descriptions are not detailed enough, or even missing, automated matching is not possible. 
Fortunately, the situation looks a bit better when considering postconditions and effects. 
There are two reasons for this: first, postconditions and effects are only concerned with the desired and actual outputs and real-world effects of the service; and secondly therefore, requesters have an interest in including detailed descriptions of the postconditions and effects in their goals.
Remark. 
One can prove in a similar way that the compactness of the embedding _MATH_ into _MATH_, _MATH_, holds if and only if _MATH_, i.e. the embedding _MATH_, _MATH_, is compact and continuous simultaneously.
To fit the gates we use a forward greedy algorithm that combines gradient boosting and bound optimization. 
It selects the variables according to functional gradient boosting _CITE_ and optimizes the resulting sub-problems using bound optimization, as described above. 
To compute the functional gradient, we rewrite the objective in terms of functions _MATH_. 
This method is applicable to any differentiable log-likelihood: _MATHDISP_ 
The functional gradient corresponding to one component of _MATH_ is: _MATHDISP_ with the full gradient of the _MATH_th gate assembled as _MATH_- the steepest descent direction in function space. 
For feature selection, we choose the row vector _MATH_ of _MATH_ with weight index not already in the active set _MATH_, and most correlated (collinear) with the gradient _CITE_: _MATHDISP_ 
We initialize _MATH_ and select the _MATH_th variable, incrementally, based on the gate parameter estimates at the previous round of selection. 
Once the _MATH_th variable is selected, we optimize _REF_ with respect to all pre-selected _MATH_ variables using bound optimization. 
We use the solution of the previous iteration to quick-start the current optimization problem (this is convex but a good initialization saves iterations). 
The advantage of bound optimization in a greedy forward selection context is that we can efficiently update the Hessian bound using the Woodbury inversion identity. 
Thus, the cost of each iteration is _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a small constant, and the total cost of selecting the _MATH_ variables is _MATH_. 
When the specified number of variables is reached, we terminate. 
Unlike gradient boosting where the only current selected variable is optimized, we also perform back-fitting _CITE_, i.e. optimize all selected variables in each round. 
To speed-up computation, it is possible to optimize the weights of the gating networks sequentially-fix the weights of other gating networks than the one currently optimized-the problem in _REF_. 
This requires the solution to a sequence of _MATH_-dimensional problems (usually _MATH_) and can be significantly cheaper than updating all gate parameters simultaneously, especially when denser (less sparse) models are desired. 
To sparsify the gating network, one can consider forward selection ideas based on maximizing the marginal likelihood, along the same lines as used for experts. 
However, the computational cost of this approach is high even for fast Bayesian approximations to multinomial classification. 
Differently from Bayesian regression, there is no analytical expression for the marginal likelihood, hence we have to resort on Laplace approximation. 
But this only works around the maximized posterior point, so we have to recompute the most probable weight and the corresponding Hessian matrix after adding or deleting an input entry (or basis function). 
For large problems this operation is computationally prohibitive.
Recently, collective waves in dusty plasmas _CITE_ (plasma with extra component of micron or submicron-sized dust particles) have drawn a baronial interest in the research of dusty plasma physics due to its relevance in laboratory plasma as well as astrophysical and space environments _CITE_. 
It has been established that dust and plasma co-exist in a wide variety of environments such as low-temperature laboratory discharges including processing plasmas in the semiconductor industry and plasma crystal. 
Voyager observation of Saturn's rings revealed the existence of rapidly elongated _MATH_ discs with light-scattering properties which contain small grains (dust). 
A well known feature dust-acoustic (DA) solitary waves (SWs), formed due to a delicate balance of nonlinearity and dispersion, may give the property of asymptotic preservation of soliton. 
The nonlinear structures, (viz. solitary, shock, double layers etc.) associated with nonlinear propagation of novel DA waves _CITE_, has received an enormous interest for understanding the electrostatic perturbations in space and laboratory dusty plasma _CITE_.
Inspired by the behaviors of ants in nature and based on chaos theory, chaotic ant swarm was developed in 2006. 
Each ant performs a chaotic exploration of its hunting positions and interacts with its neighbors. 
These ants search chaotically until they have been organized via pheromone trails (or visual landmarks), and then move to the position, which is the most successful one among the previously met hunting positions. 
These principles were used to implement heuristic algorithms for the search of a global optimum or near optimum of a function in a search space. 
Due to the recent successful results in a variety of continuous optimization problems, CAS has been applied successfully to solve some problems _CITE_. 
The problem of parameter estimation of the dynamical system was converted to that of parameter optimization via CAS _CITE_. 
The designing of fuzzy system using chaotic ant swarm algorithm was presented, which can successfully be used to the nonlinear system identification, time series prediction and nonlinear adaptive control _CITE_. 
Li Y. et al. proposed hybrid chaotic swarm optimization based on CAS, which enhanced the solution accuracy and stability greatly of CAS for function optimization _CITE_. 
CAS was employed to solve the economic dispatch problems of thermal generators _CITE_. 
Wan M. et al. devised a clustering technique based on CAS for detecting groups of Web users from Web access logs, and this proposed approach was applied to a pre-fetching task which predicted user requests with encouraging results _CITE_. 
Chaotic ant swarm algorithms, due to their implicity in coding and their global exploration abilities, are usually applied in continuous optimization problems with remarkable results. 
However, we focused in the way a CAS algorithm can easily and efficiently be applied in a classic combinatorial optimization problem, like the traveling salesman problem.
Integrals with _MATH_- in the denominator can also be calculated by the standard method provided one eliminates the singularity at _MATH_. 
In fact the sum of (_REF_) and (_REF_) can be rewritten as _MATHDISP_. 
where as before _MATH_. 
Now we can safely put _MATH_ in the first factor and _MATH_ in the brackets without losing convergence. 
The integral again factorizes in two: _MATHDISP_- where _MATH_ is the same as before and given by (_REF_) and _MATHDISP_. 
Here we can safely neglect the term _MATH_- in the denominator since this product is to be small as compared to squares of the transverse momenta. 
The singularity at _MATH_ then becomes spurious. 
Indeed changing _MATH_- and taking half of the sum we get _MATHDISP_. 
The bracket vanishes at _MATH_ so that there is no singularity at this point. 
Taking the residue in the upper half-plane we find _MATHDISP_, so that (_REF_) again coincides with (_REF_) calculated in our previous manner.
In the last Step 7 is executed the unfolding of _TIMES_ binary operators to leafs, as specified by tensorial ("Cartesian") product of the two paths in Proposition _REF_, and hence we obtained the final normalized one path-term with the unique leaf which is a term in _MATH_ (a Cartesian product of relational tables with all updates).
Based on the mathematically well defined Pade Theory, a theoretically safe new procedure for the extraction of the pole mass and width of a resonance is proposed. 
In particular, thanks to the Montessus de Ballore theorem we are able to unfold the Second Riemann Sheet of an amplitude to search for the position of the resonance pole in the complex plane. 
The method is systematic and provides a model-independent treatment of the prediction and the corresponding errors of the approximation. 
Likewise, it can be used in combination with other well-established approaches to improve future determinations of resonance parameters.
defocus (caused by M2 or M3/M4 axial misalignment): needs to be corrected in closed loop (focus drifts due to temperature changes)
Next we investigate nontest modules in resolving subcategories. 
For _MATH_ we denote by _MATH_ the resolving closure of _MATH_. 
The full subcategory of _MATH_ consisting of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules is denote by _MATH_.
Now using the initial conditions given in the last subsection, we can solve the evolving equations (_REF_)-(_REF_) and (_REF_) numerically to obtain the evolution of the density perturbation and then get the evolution of the curvature perturbation _MATH_ by using Eq.(_REF_). 
We have displayed the results in Fig._REF_ and Fig._REF_. 
In the two figures, we have fixed the parameters as _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
And we have taken _MATH_ and the initial values of _MATH_ to be _MATH_. 
In Fig._REF_, we show the evolutions of _MATH_ for fixed _MATH_ and different _MATH_. 
And in Fig._REF_ we show the evolutions of _MATH_ for fixed _MATH_ and different _MATH_. 
The evolutions displayed in Fig._REF_ and Fig._REF_ manifest the standard power-law growth and no instabilities are present, which are similar the results in _CITE_.
We find a periodic solution of Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_). 
The problem is considered for initial conditions: _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It is obvious that if _MATH_ the system (_REF_)-(_REF_) has a periodic solution given by the functions: _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Now, we suppose that if _MATH_ the set of Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_) also has periodic solution with unknown frequencies _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In order to avoid dealing with the unknown frequencies in the system (_REF_)-(_REF_) we put _MATH_. 
This leads to _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
On inserting (_REF_) and (_REF_) into (_REF_)-(_REF_) we obtain the equations of motion in the new variables: _MATHDISP_. 
In this case we can look for series solutions of the form: _MATHDISP_ 
On substituting (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_) into (_REF_) we get a recursive set of equations: _MATHDISP_ with the initial conditions: _MATHDISP_. 
The dot denotes that differentiations are with respect to _MATH_. 
The zero-order solutions are: _MATHDISP_. 
On substituting (_REF_) and (_REF_) into (_REF_) and (_REF_) we have: _MATHDISP_. 
The secular terms are: _MATH_ and _MATH_.
In contrast, if _MATH_, then _MATH_ remains in _MATH_ that is the stability region of open state _MATH_. 
Hence eventually _MATH_ moves back to open state again. 
In the following, we will not consider the Eq.(_REF_) in the lower energy limit (_MATH_) or in the high energy limit (_MATH_) as our initiating point, instead we will study the full Eq.(_REF_).
For many extremal problems in discrete geometry, the only known computational approach is one based enumeration of possible (abstract) configurations. 
Even when the complete search space is not visited, more efficient techniques for enumeration can be useful as part of some other algorithm. 
In this paper we focus on incidence problems, where matroids are a good model. 
We are able to find the new results discussed above thanks to an improved algorithm for the enumeration of matroids.
Throughout the paper, we will assume _MATH_, _MATH_ and
(_MATH_) _MATH_ is odd, _MATH_ is the ratio of two positive odd integers,
(_MATH_) _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_.
It is easily seen from Theorem _REF_ that the marginal distribution functions in the combined sample can be represented as a mixture of distribution functions of order statistics. 
Given Guilbaud's result (see Section _REF_), the question arises whether the distribution of the combined sample is connected to progressively Type-II censored order statistics. 
Denote by _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and by _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, uniform progressively Type-II censored order statistics based on censoring schemes _MATHDISP_, respectively. 
Now, Theorem _REF_ shows that the distribution of the combined ordered sample _MATH_ is indeed a mixture of progressively Type-II censored order statistics from the uniform distribution with simple weights. 
Observe that the censoring schemes can be seen as different one-step censoring schemes (with additional right censoring). 
Thus, progressively Type-II censored order statistics have become useful to represent this combined two-sample model and its subsequent analysis. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be as in Lemma _REF_. 
The distribution of _MATH_ is a mixture of progressively Type-II censored samples from the uniform distribution, i.e., _MATHDISP_. 
The proof of Theorem _REF_ is presented in the appendix. 
Here, we illustrate this result by considering the events _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Conditionally on the event _MATH_, the random vector _MATH_ is given by _MATH_. 
Taking into account an iid sample of size _MATH_ from _MATH_, this particular sample can be seen as follows. 
First, the _MATH_ smallest observations are noted. 
Then, _MATH_ larger variables of the original sample are randomly withdrawn. 
Afterwards, the next _MATH_ observations are considered, which means that the largest _MATH_ variates are censored. 
This procedure corresponds to the progressive censoring method associated with the progressive censoring scheme _MATH_. 
Next, let _MATH_. 
Conditionally on the event _MATH_, the random vector _MATH_ is then given by _MATH_, _MATH_, where _MATH_ is some arrangement of the variables _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Hence, _MATH_ equal the first _MATH_ order statistics in a sample of size _MATH_. 
Then, _MATH_ larger variables are withdrawn from the sample, and the remaining ordered observations follow. 
Thus, this sample corresponds to a progressively Type-II censored sample associated with the progressive censoring scheme _MATH_. 
Since the combined ordered sample has its distribution as a mixture of progressively Type-II censored order statistics, different representations of the marginal distribution functions can be derived from the different representations of the marginal distribution functions of progressively Type-II censored order statistics; see _CITE_. 
Moreover, since two-dimensional marginal distributions of progressively Type-II censored order statistics can be easily calculated [see _CITE_ and _CITE_], we can use Theorem _REF_ to obtain tolerance intervals as well. 
Details of this will be given later in Section _REF_ where we also present a different approach which is easier to extend to the case when two progressively Type-II right censored samples are combined. 
As mentioned before, _CITE_ has expressed the distribution of progressively Type-II censored order statistics as a mixture of distributions of order statistics. 
Hence, Theorem _REF_ reveals that the distribution of _MATH_ is a mixture of mixtures of the usual order statistics from a sample of size _MATH_. 
Using the expressions given in Theorem _REF_, coverage probabilities of one- and two-sided non-parametric confidence intervals can be easily calculated. 
Obviously, the maximum one-sided confidence levels in the samples _MATH_ and _MATH_ are _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
Furthermore, the maximum two-sided confidence level is given by _MATH_. 
Comparing these values with the maximum confidence levels in the combined ordered sample, we obtain the maximum gains in the coverage probabilities for _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Lemma _REF_ especially shows that the maximum gain for the two-sided confidence interval is larger than that of the one-sided confidence intervals. 
The maximum gains in the coverage probabilities _MATH_ are given by
 (a) _MATH_,
 (b) _MATH_,
 (c) _MATH_.
We define the capacity as _MATHDISP_. 
We define two subsets of _MATH_: _MATH_ - consisting of _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is concave on all half-lines _MATH_ ; _MATH_ - consisting of _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is convex on all half-lines _MATH_.
_MATH_ (Linking Theorem) Let _MATH_ be a Banach space with _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be such that _MATH_. 
Define _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ be such that _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ satisfies the _MATH_ condition with _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, then _MATH_ is a critical value of _MATH_. 
Remark 1 If _MATH_ satisfies the _MATH_ condition, Then Theorem 1 still holds.
From the following facts (a) _MATH_ has a path from _MATH_ to _MATH_, (b) the rated capacity of each link of _MATH_ is more than 0, (c) the last basic interval of the global time list always extends to _MATH_, and (d) the available bandwidth of each link is its rated capacity during this last basic interval, it follows that the max flow from _MATH_ to _MATH_ in the last basic interval is non-zero and so the remaining file size _MATH_ can always be scheduled for transfer in this last basic interval. 
Hence, GOS is able to schedule every file transfer request.
According to the Radon-Nikodym theorem, if _MATH_ then the distribution _MATH_ is a measure and there exist a vector-valued function _MATH_ and a measure _MATH_, singular with respect to the _MATH_-dimensional Lebesgue measure _MATH_ restricted to _MATH_, such that _MATH_.
We discuss the codimension-two bifurcation with 1:2 strong resonance (see [5] and Chap. 
9 in [49]) for model (1.1) at equilibria _MATH_ and _MATH_ when parameters _MATH_ vary in a small neighborhood of _MATH_, _MATH_ or _MATH_, respectively.
For FOCP, such a definition of ORA as a zero-pole transfer function is not helpful. 
Instead, a state space realization of the approximation is required. 
The first step toward a state space realization is to expand the transfer function given in (_REF_): _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Equation (_REF_) can further be modified to match the following definition: _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_. 
It is finally possible to approximate the operator _MATH_ using a state space definition _MATHDISP_, with _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
So, the remaining part _REF_ of the product _MATH_ is equal to _MATH_ times the sum of _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_, that is to say _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, the product _MATH_ is the sum of the quantities _REF_ and _REF_ when _MATH_ and _MATH_ is odd.
On one hand, assuming that _MATH_ does not depends explicitly on _MATH_, _MATH_ is equal to : _MATHDISP_ Note that in the last expression, the product _MATH_ has to be understood in the sense that _MATH_ replaces _MATH_ at each place the gradient is acting on the series expansion of _MATH_.
Transactional systems are based upon a premise that applications can be divided into client programs and server programs, such that the client programs have minimal interactions with one another. 
Such an architecture can be visualized as a set of wheels, with database servers forming the hubs to which client programs are connected by communication pathways-the spokes. 
One client program can interact with multiple database servers, but although the issues this raises are well understood, such multi-database configurations are relatively uncommon in commercial practice. 
Existing client/server database applications consist of some set of disjoint groups, each group containing a database server and its associated clients, with no interaction between client programs except through sharing a database, and with very few, if any, client programs that interact with multiple databases simultaneously. 
Moreover, although it is known how to replicate databases for increased availability and loadbalancing (see Bernstein et al., Gray and Reuter), relatively little use is made of this option in existing systems. 
Thus, the hubs of distributed database systems rarely interact with one another. 
(We'll see why this is the case in Part III; ultimately, the issue turns out to be one of performance.)
We will study the simplest inflationary model, that gives us a de Sitter epoch. 
Electromagnetic studies in this context have been developed previously by _CITE_. 
To introduce the electromagnetic effects we consider a massless vector field _MATH_ of five components. 
The component normal to the hypersurface has properties similar to a scalar field, so its spectrum, with the Coulomb Gauge, we will see it can only be scale invariant.
3.1. set stepwidth to _MATH_; 3.2. find starting point _MATH_ for the current pair _MATH_ that holds the constraints _REF_
The dynamical part of the current depends on the initial Hamiltonian _MATH_ through the amplitudes _MATH_ of Eq. (_REF_). 
In the first example of the previous Section the Hamiltonian at negative times, _MATH_, had no bound eigenstates. 
At positive times a gate voltage and a bias in the left lead were suddenly switched on and the Hamiltonian at positive times is equal to _MATH_ and has two bound eigenstates. 
We now consider a system with two bound eigenstates for _MATH_ and exposed to a dc bias for _MATH_. 
Specifically, we start with a static potential describing a quantum well of depth _MATH_ a.u. for _MATH_ a.u.. 
The ground state of the system is the Slater determinant of all the extended eigenstates with energy up to _MATH_ a.u. and of the two bound eigenstates at energies _MATH_ a.u. and _MATH_ a.u.. 
At _MATH_ a dc bias _MATH_ a.u. is suddenly switched on in the left lead and the Hamiltonian _MATH_ is equal to the final Hamiltonian studied in the previous Section. 
The resulting time-dependent current for these two systems are shown in Fig. _REF_.
There are two new methods to calculate the inverse of a pentadiagonal matrix. 
The computational complexity of the Zhao and Huang's algorithm is _MATH_. 
The degree of complexity is one degree higher than the discussed algorithm. 
Hence, the algorithm parallelized in this paper is more efficient than their algorithm. 
The Hadj and Elouafi's algorithm is an efficient algorithm and has the same degree with the proposed algorithm, computational complexity of _MATH_. 
But the coefficient of the highest degree of computational complexity is higher. 
Therefore it is also less efficient than the proposed method.
In Table 4.4(a), note the coverage of the NORMAL intervals decreases monotonically as _MATH_ increases, yielding over-coverage in the region where skewness exists, and under-coverage in the region with (close to) normal errors. 
Such a clear pattern does not exist in Table 4.5(a), suggesting that the NORMAL intervals may be more influenced by data skewness rather than kurtosis (at least when the deviations in the latter are small); this is consistent with the Edgeworth expansion approach to the related problem of confidence interval construction.
In this paper, we develop a model for the joint distribution of response choice and response time (RT) that we believe occupies this middle ground. 
The model captures a processing commitment: evidence for a response grows gradually in time in separate, independent, racing accumulators. 
The response is made when one of these accumulators first wins the race, that is, it first attains sufficient evidence. 
We adopt perhaps the simplest version of this race-between-accumulators theme, and show how it retains desirable properties of useful psychometric models. 
Not only is the model statistically tractable, it is straightforward to place sophisticated model components, such as auto-regressive components, on model parameters.
In general, _MATH_ are non-negative random self adjoint operators, _MATH_ are symmetric about 0 and we write _MATH_ for real valued variables, _MATH_ for vectors and _MATH_ for Rademacher variables.
At first we present a simplified 3D rubberband algorithm (i.e., Algorithm _REF_ in Figure _REF_), which is later used as a subprocess in our main algorithm (i.e., Algorithm _REF_ in Figure _REF_). 
Algorithm _REF_ will call Procedure _REF_ (in Figure _REF_) which will call Procedure _REF_ in Figure _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ (_MATH_) be the start point (endpoint) on the surface of a convex polyhedron _MATH_.
A high level abstraction of the information space that may determine an executor's profile is a bi-partite graph, where nodes denote either performers or content elements, and edges may connect performers (to denote, e.g., friendship), content elements (to denote semantic relationships) and performers to content elements (to denote, e.g., interest). 
The bi-partite graph representation can be refined by attaching semantics to both nodes and edges: users can be associated with profile data; content elements can be summarized or classified in topics; edges between performers can express explicit friendship or implicit ties due to interactions between users; edges between content element can express ontological knowledge, like classification, part-of, etc.; edges between users and content items can represent a specific capability (e.g., ability to review, produce, or judge about content elements).
The asymptotic behaviour of solutions of (_REF_) with _MATH_ and _MATH_ has not been studied directly. 
It has been studied by using some canonical transformations due to Trench, as discussed in Section 6.1 of this chapter. 
It would be interesting to study the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of (_REF_) directly. 
Further, when _MATH_ and _MATH_, then no result exists in finding sufficient conditions under which (_REF_) with _MATH_ admits a nonoscillatory solution satisfying the property (_REF_). 
This still remains an open problem.
The interfaces in the component diagram are, instead, annotated with the execution time they require for the software component to be accomplished. 
This time represents the total execution time required locally to the component in order to satisfy the request. 
This information is specified by either the PAdemand or PAdelay tag values of the &lt;&lt;PAstep&gt;&gt; stereotype. 
The approach associates such stereotype to each component interface by assuming that an interface contains just an operation from which it inherits the name. 
This assumption eases the annotation of the service demands in component diagram. 
In general, an interface is composed by a set of operations provided or required by a software component. 
Here, to simplify the presentation of the parameterizations phase, we assume that an interface is composed of a single operation from with the interface derives the name. 
Figure _REF_ shows the component diagram of the e-commerce system annotated following the assumption of the SAP_MATH_one approach.
Eq. (_REF_) is written without taking into account any corrections due to energy conservation. 
As has been discussed in the 80'th (see Refs. _CITE_), these corrections are important for the calculation of the correlations. 
Generally speaking, in Pomeron calculus the long range correlations in rapidity stem from the production of two hadrons from two different Pomerons (two different parton showers, see Fig. _REF_). 
In other words, two hadrons in the central rapidity region can be produced in an event with more than two parton showers (see Fig. _REF_). 
This is shown in Fig. _REF_-a in an eikonal type model, where the proton-proton scattering amplitude is written as: _MATHDISP_. 
The cross section of _MATH_ parton showers production is equal to (see Refs._CITE_ and references therein) _MATHDISP_. 
Eq. (_REF_) shows that the parton showers are distributed according to Poisson distribution with an average number of parton showers _MATH_ which has the following form in the simple model of Eq. (_REF_): _MATHDISP_.
An important property of a communication network is its capacity to withstand node and link failures. 
For example, it may be required to know the largest number of link failures that result in a disconnected network where there is not a walk between every pair of computing nodes. 
Similarly, in graphs, we may need to determine the number of edge removals that will result in a disconnected network. 
Connectivity of a network is the determination of such parameters. 
Also, vertex and edge deletion methods are important in some of the algorithms as the ones we will see in Part II which require removing a vertex from the graph at each iteration.
Due to the specific goals in practice, many biological, social and technological networks functionally divide into communities. 
Therefore, cluster synchronization of complex dynamical networks has received increasing interest and had many applications in practice. 
For example, two subgroups will be naturally formed in social networks when a crowd of people choose to accept or reject an opinion according to their preference. 
When a group of robots are to carry out a complex task, subtasks will divide the robot network into communities, and consensus should be achieved within each community. 
By introducing the inhibitory coupling to the coupling matrix, some sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the cluster synchronization of linearly coupled complex networks under pinning control _CITE_. 
In _CITE_, the authors investigated both local and global stability conditions for cluster synchronization of complex dynamical networks, in which at least those nodes with direct connections between groups in a network with community structure should be pinned. 
By introducing local adaptive strategies for both coupling strengths and feedback gains, it was shown that the collective dynamics of the underlying complex network can be controlled to its heterogeneous stationary states without requiring global information of the network _CITE_. 
By proposing an adaptive pinning feedback to the coupling strength, reference _CITE_ derived sufficient conditions for cluster synchronization with nonlinearly coupled nonidentical dynamical systems and asymmetrical coupling matrix. 
In _CITE_, some sufficient conditions were derived to guarantee global cluster synchronization by using intermittent pinning control. 
In _CITE_, several sufficient conditions were proposed to guarantee cluster synchronization of complex dynamical networks via the free matrix approach and stochastic analysis techniques, when at least one node in each cluster was pinned. 
Cluster synchronization of complex dynamical networks with community structure and nonidentical nodes was studied via pinning control and adaptive coupling strength _CITE_.
In order to systematically explore the near-surface variations in thermal structure associated with regions of strong magnetic activity, we have analyzed a representative sample of solar active regions using the technique of differential ring-diagram analysis. 
Ring-diagram analysis, which relies on frequencies of high-degree modes, can be used to study properties of small regions on the Sun (Hill 1988) using 3D power spectra in temporal frequency and the two components of the horizontal wave-number. 
The frequencies of these high-degree modes are determined by the structure of the underlying region. 
There are a number of systematic effects in ring diagram analysis that make it difficult to determine the absolute structure of a given region (see for example Hindman, Haber, Toomre, et al., 2000). 
Most of these systematic effects can be eliminated, however, by studying the differences in frequencies between different regions with the same observing geometry: this is the technique of differential ring-diagram analysis (Basu, Antia, and Bogart 2004, hereafter BAB). 
To study the effect of magnetic fields, we can take the frequency differences between an active region and a quiet region, preferably at the same latitude and not too distant longitude.
Figures _REF_ and _REF_ compare the performance for Fast Ethernet network. 
In this case we can see that the overall execution time of methods that require inter-processor communication (Two Phase I/O and IEC I/O) increases. 
This is due to a slower inter-processor network. 
In contrast, the performance of both List I/O and Block I/O is similar to the one measured for the Myrinet Network. 
Note also that PVFS filesystem keeps using Myrinet network. 
For larger _MATH_, List I/O performance is better than Two Phase I/O. 
We can also note that for larger _MATH_, there is not an important difference between the performance of IEC I/O and Two Phase I/O.
Several models have been developed to explain how water transport can drive trap closure. 
Forterre et al. suggested that leaf geometry plays a role in creating a buckling instability generating the force required to initiate the fast closure event _CITE_. 
Bobji assumed that the Venus flytrap is a bistable vibrator and stable in both the open and closed states _CITE_. 
Markin et al. proposed a hydroelastic curvature model, in which the lobes have curvature elasticity and different hydraulic pressures in the inner and outer layers _CITE_. 
These models partially describe the closure process (from open to semi-closed states) after stimulation, but cannot explain the reopening and the sealing processes (from semi-closed to other states). 
Markin et al. considered an intermediate state in their model, at which the mean curvature was zero; however, instead of using the semi-closed state, they used the intermediate state to represent a state between the open and semi-closed states _CITE_.
Figure _REF_ shows the multiple beam splitting by re-organizing the three rods at the PCW exit. 
By displacing rod "2" and "3" towards rod "1" by _MATH_ in both the _MATH_ and _MATH_ directions, we can modify the one-to-five splitter to the one-to-three splitter. 
Such a collimation is the result of interference.
We have the following very useful semiclassical result. 
For every complex numbers _MATH_ with positive imaginary part we have:
In the following, some Lemmas and Assumptions are presented, which are used throughout this paper. 
[14] 
If _MATH_ satisfies _MATH_ and _MATH_, then for any two vectors _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_.
Considering Eqs. (3.19) and (3.20) of the impedance boundary conditions at _MATH_ and _MATH_, it is obtained readily. _MATHDISP_.
The work is organized in 6 sections as follows. 
In Section _REF_, we describe the model, separating the presentation into five subsections to improve its readability. 
In Section _REF_, we set up the stochastic control problem and (in Section _REF_) discuss the structure of the set of admissible strategies depending on the solvency level _MATH_. 
In Section _REF_, we develop the dynamic programming approach, proving various results about the properties of the value function (Section _REF_), the fact that it is a regular solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (Section _REF_), the verification theorem, and the optimal feedback policies for _MATH_ (Section _REF_). 
In Section _REF_, we consider the case _MATH_ and solve analytically the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for a specific utility function, finding the value function and the optimal policies. 
In Section _REF_, we give an analysis of the optimal policies underlying the role of the solvency level. 
Section _REF_ concludes the paper.
Since the heating process of the solar wind is still largely disputed (see Section _REF_), we cannot rely on a model to derive the amount of heating, then presently theory cannot provide an estimation of the coefficient _MATH_ and _MATH_ in Equation (_REF_). 
However, with the hypothesis _MATH_, the observed radial gradient of temperature provides an interval of _MATH_. 
With the reference velocity set to _MATH_km s_MATH_, we explore a range of _MATH_ values in order to cover the observed range of observed _MATH_ (Figure _REF_). 
This implicitly defined the amount of heat needed, so the coefficient _MATH_ [Equation (_REF_)].
Note that if a given state _MATH_ is pure, then a Hilbert space _MATH_ becomes _MATH_, i.e. _MATH_ in (_REF_). 
In the following we will denote the entangling operator defined in (_REF_) by the indifferently symbol _MATH_.
In this study, we shall apply differential quadrature method based on polynomials given by _CITE_ for space discretization and classical Runge-Kutta method of order four for time discretization to obtain numerical solutions of NLSE with cubic nonlinearity for various initial conditions. 
In fact, NLSE has some analytic solutions, but we have aimed to test the accuracy of the DQM by measuring the error between the analytical and numerical solutions we obtain.
Klimenok and Dudin _CITE_ consider a multi server queue with both finite and infinite buffers. 
The input is according to BMAP and services are _MATH_ phase distributed. 
Negative customers arrive according to MAP. 
A negative customer can remove a customer in service provided the latter is in an unprotected phase of service. 
On the other hand if the service is in protected phase, the negative arrival will not have any effect. 
In the case of finite system, the authors obtain probability of loss of a customer due to capacity restriction. 
The stationary distribution of the finite as well as infinite buffer system is computed. 
Also the waiting time distribution is computed in both cases. 
Further several system performance characteristics are analyzed. 
Another work on negative arrivals can be see in _CITE_.
Figure _REF_ shows the result obtained, clearly identifying the locking of the GE formulation when full integration is employed: in this case, as the thickness-to-span ratio diminishes, the relative errors are of the order of 1. 
In the other two implementation no locking of this type appears. 
The GE implementation with reduced integration shows more accuracy for every value of the comparison parameter, but the accuracy of the ANC beam does not get worse when the ratio thickness-to-span goes to zero. 
We would like to stress that Fig. _REF_ is not a convergence plot, and the relative error need not approach zero as the thickness-to-span ratio does.
So far we considered the energy functions of the form (_REF_) with couplings _MATH_ and magnetic field _MATH_. 
Now we also admit an interaction of a spin with itself, in which case the energy function can be written as _MATHDISP_, For simplicity we assumed that the self-interaction _MATH_ is the same at all lattice sites. 
If _MATH_ then the energy function belongs to a Gaussian model. 
On the other hand, we may adjust the couplings _MATH_ in to order find the Euclidean action of an interacting scalar field on the lattice. 
Similarly, we may regard the energy (_REF_) of the _MATH_ spin model as the Euclidean action for the non-linear _MATH_-sigma model on a lattice: _MATHDISP_. 
The idea of identifying spin configurations as lattice fields of a discretized Euclidean field theory and energy functions as Euclidean actions according to _MATHDISP_ has been very fruitful for the progress of non-perturbative quantum field theory as well as statistical physics.
A graph is a tuple _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a nonempty set of _MATH_ (or _MATH_) and _MATH_, is a set of _MATH_. 
Each edge has either one or two endpoints, that is, each edge is either a one or two element subset of _MATH_.
A similar calculation can be done for _MATH_. 
Here we find that the result of _CITE_ is also reproduced, after removal of a spurious counter-term _MATH_.
Definition 3 (tour). 
Let _MATH_ be a set. 
A tour is a permutation that there exist distinct elements _MATH_ of _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Each tour can be described by a permuted list of the cities number (from 1 to _MATH_).
Transfer function sensitivity: Transfer function sensitivities (i.e. changes in an entire transfer function relative to a component variation) are more complex and thus difficult to use. 
Basically they are the functions of frequency and component values, which is shown in Fig. _REF_.
The results in Fig6 show that the range for power consumption of controller is same when identical constants (_MATH_, _MATH_) are used, therefore, it could be concluded that the power consumption of controller could be independent of the selection of the two gain coefficients, but it is dependent on the selection for the two constants (_MATH_, _MATH_). 
Compared the results in Fig7 with the ones in Fig6, it is confirmed that the two constants (_MATH_, _MATH_) play critical role in power consumption of controller, less power consumption of controller is required with larger _MATH_ or smaller _MATH_ being used.
Output: a logically equivalent implication with extended set of variables.
In Sections _REF_ and _REF_ we have given an extensive description of both of these effects for linear acoustic-gravity waves in the pure adiabatic case. 
In a forthcoming paper, this approach will be extended to non-adiabatic waves, which are a more adequate representation in the low photosphere, by means of the Newtonian cooling approximation.
Besides the ones presented in Section _REF_, many methodologies in the literature propose transformation techniques to derive Queueing Network (QN) based models-possibly Extended QN (EQN) or Layered QN (LQN)-from Software Architecture (SA) specifications or SA patterns. 
Most of the proposed methods are based on the Software Performance Engineering (SPE) methodology introduced in _CITE_ and briefly described in Chapter _REF_.
In order to create the distributed infrastructure, a complex and time-consuming attack preparation phase is required. 
Within this phase an attacker tries to build the botnet that will then be used to generate DDoS attacks and other illicit network activities (such as sending high volumes unsolicited emails).
In order to test our benchmark, we compared our ISTs (see Chapter _REF_) with the widely used Voxmap Pointshell (VPS) approach (see Section _REF_). 
Both algorithms facilitate and assume a penalty-based haptic rendering method, which allows colliding objects to penetrate each other to some degree. 
The two algorithms use different definitions of penetration: the one by VPS is closely related to the (local) translational penetration depth, while the one by IST is the intersection volume.
In some compounds,_CITE_ e.g. in the high-temperature superconductors Sr_MATH_RuO_MATH_ and Tl_MATH_Ba_MATH_CuO_MATH_, the body-centered tetragonal symmetry of the crystal leads to the _MATH_-dependent lowest-order interlayer transfer integral, _MATH_, in the all or some parts of the FS. 
Then, instead of Eq. (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_. 
To extract the in-plane FS anisotropy _MATH_ in the first order in the _MATH_-dependent interlayer transfer integral, one needs to consider _MATH_ harmonic in the cross-section area. 
Then, in the lowest order in _MATH_ we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
For Sr_MATH_RuO_MATH_ and Tl_MATH_Ba_MATH_CuO_MATH_, the number _MATH_. 
The results of Eq. (_REF_) and the new formula (_REF_) strongly differ again. 
In particular, the _MATH_-dependence of the _MATH_ harmonic, which determines the parameter _MATH_ of the FS shape, in Eq. (_REF_) is, approximately, _MATH_ times stronger than in Eq. (_REF_).
In this paper, the impulsive synchronization of drive-response complex-variable chaotic systems has been well investigated. 
Both the drive-response systems with known and unknown system parameters have been considered. 
Base on the Lyapunov stability theory, proper controllers are designed by combining impulsive control and adaptive strategy. 
Noticeably, the proposed method can relax the restriction on the impulsive interval and the system parameters need not to be known beforehand. 
All the derived results have been verified to be effective by several numerical examples.
In particular, _MATH_ is a _MATH_-algebra. 
We have even more than this: _MATH_ is the free _MATH_-algebra generated by _MATH_.
In the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) nearly massless _MATH_ (3 pions in the case _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the number of light quark flavors) emerge as (quasi) pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons as a consequence of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry: _MATH_. 
In the context of a linear _MATH_-model this spontaneous breaking is induced by a negative squared mass of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. 
This feature is responsible for the typical Mexican hat form of the mesonic potential.
Now, following Remark _REF_, since the adjustment factors affect both input signal and noise power simultaneously, one can write _MATHDISP_ 
That is, for noise power a relation similar to (_REF_) holds, i.e., _MATHDISP_, Moreover, let us note that _MATHDISP_ Thus one can see that in this second case with _MATH_ adjustment factors (_MATH_-link), the same recursive OSNR model as in (_REF_) and Lemma _REF_ is valid on a per-link basis.
To complete the model, a set of equations that describe the evolution of the internal variables, i.e. the viscoplastic strain rate and the drag strength, needs to be provided.
As Figure _REF_ shows, the situation at _MATH_ can be approximated by measuring the distances between _MATH_ and the tangent to _MATH_ at _MATH_ along equi-distant lines perpendicular to the tangent. 
In Figure _REF_, positive distances are represented by bold line segments and negative distances by "hollow" line segments. 
The area between the curve and the tangent line can be approximated by summing these distances; it is positive on the left, negative on the right, and zero in the middle where the positive and negative distances cancel.
In the case that _MATH_, it will be sometimes necessary to approximate _MATH_ with measurable subsets of finite measure. 
Since _MATH_ is _MATH_-finite, there exist _MATH_, _MATH_, such that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We define _MATH_, _MATH_, as the smallest filtration satisfying the usual conditions and containing the filtration _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_. 
It is straightforward to see that _MATH_, and that the _MATH_-compensators of the Poisson random measures _MATHDISP_ have the following form: _MATHDISP_. 
We will adopt the analogous notation of approximating filtrations and compensators for enlarged filtrations _MATH_.
Before 2004 Hawking had believed that during the evolution process the information is not conservative and the evolution of black hole does not satisfy the unitary principle of quantum mechanics [3]. 
Some physicists advocate that the information should be conserved during the evolution process and the evolution of black hole satisfies the unitary principle of quantum mechanics [4]. 
However, the aforesaid two view points were not proved for 30 years. 
Until 2004, in the 17_MATH_ international conference on General Relativity and Gravition, Hawking brought a tremendous convulsion. 
He proposed that the information should be conservative during the black hole formation and evaporation process [5]. 
But Hawking did not prove strictly the fact.
A trace _MATH_ of the Node _MATH_ is an event sequence _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATH_ is initial configuration of _MATH_. 
The trace projection _MATH_ on _MATH_ is an event sequence that _MATH_ takes from its initial configuration while its supper Node _MATH_ follows trace _MATH_ from its initial configuration. 
This projection is calculated by the following recursive relation. 
_MATHDISP_ 
A Node has control over its internal and output events. 
However, input events of a Node is under control of its supper Node. 
If _MATH_ is an internal or output event of the Node _MATH_, then _MATH_ will append on _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ is an output event of other Nodes which indexes a vector _MATH_ with _MATH_ as input event of _MATH_, then _MATH_ will be appended to the trace projection; otherwise, _MATH_ is not appended on _MATH_.
When games started to take advantage of GPU processing power for performing geometry modeling tasks, developers faced with the problem of correctly interacting with models deformed on the rendering pipeline. 
Since the original item buffer technique can only returns the object identifier, ray picking is still used when the application requires geometric properties at the intersection points, as in snapping. 
For models that undergo mesh skinning, a common workaround is to duplicate the processing code on the GPU and CPU so that the CPU version is used whenever accurate interactions are required and the GPU version is used for rendering. 
Hence, duplicate processing happens during interaction, reflecting the drawbacks of the dependency of the CPU for performing interaction tasks.
Our algorithm can be summarized as follows: we first isolate the frames individually, and get their corresponding initial super resolution estimates within the Bayesian framework by exploiting the information available in the compressed bitstream. 
Then we use a robust optical flow algorithm _CITE_ to estimate the motion vectors between the estimated initial HR frames. 
Finally, a final SR image can be obtained with the neighboring initial estimates.
In order to get a better illustration of our results, let us suppose that now, among _MATH_ measurements, we choose to have a sub ensemble of _MATH_ permeability measurements taken at locations very close together, say close to _MATH_. 
Using standard algebra about determinants, see Annex _REF_, it can be shown that we have _MATHDISP_, In practice, this means that having _MATH_ independent repetitions of the measurement at the same location _MATH_, corresponds essentially to considering only one measurement at this location, but with its variance reduced by a factor _MATH_. 
This is a consequence of the central limit theorem. 
This result sounds quite natural and corresponds well to merging _MATH_ measurements. 
This formula can be used to get an asymptotic estimation of _MATH_ when the number of measurements _MATH_ goes to infinity: we have _MATH_.
The term "spotless days" refers to a count of the number of days in some interval during which no sunspots were observed. 
The number of spotless days reaches a maximum near solar minimum and is a candidate for determining both the timing of solar minimum and as a precursor of the amplitude of the upcoming cycle. 
The current minimum had more spotless days than any minimum since 1920.
Additionally, two measurements of the error are used to show the quantitative variation of the forecasts. 
These measurements are: the average absolute error _MATH_ and the average percent error _MATH_: _MATHDISP_
Now, let us consider a specific case. 
When _MATH_ and _MATH_, (_REF_) is simplified as _MATHDISP_. 
In this case, one can introduce the following effective permittivity and effective permeability to describe the transmission characteristics of the waveguide in the same way as that in _CITE_ _MATHDISP_. 
Further, it is observed that _CITE_:
The presented results are within the uncertainties in good agreement with the known ratios from photosphere, solar energetic particles (SEP), earth and meteorites, see Table _REF_ and references therein. 
Also the isotope abundance ratios for nickel agree with the known values, see Table _REF_ and references therein.
In this paper, we use the Caputo-type fractional derivative defined in _CITE_ by _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the value of _MATH_ rounded up to the nearest integer, _MATH_ is the gamma function and _MATH_ is the Riemann-Liouville integral operator defined by: _MATHDISP_ 
The Laplace transform of the caputo derivative is: _MATHDISP_. 
For zero initial conditions we have _MATH_.
We apply the estimated model to simulate the effects of two hypothetical revenue-neutral, flat-rate tax scenarios on university enrollment in Germany. 
The simulation results indicate that a revenue-neutral, flat tax scenario with an unchanged basic tax allowance would significantly increase the cumulative probability of university enrollment for male high-school graduates by 1.8 percentage points (five years after high-school graduation), which corresponds to a relative increase of 3.1%. 
For men, the positive incentive effect of the flat tax reform thus outweighs the negative insurance effect. 
Because of women's lower expected wages though, the simulated flat tax scenario with an unchanged basic allowance would not have a significant effect on the cumulative enrollment probability of female high-school graduates.
Figure _REF_ displays the three-dimensional reconstruction result for a section of the lunar surface south-west of the crater Aristarchus with its bright ray system. 
This surface part displays a strongly non-uniform albedo. 
In this example, surface reconstruction is performed based on two images taken at different solar elevation angles _MATH_ and _MATH_ but virtually identical solar azimuth angles, using error term (_REF_). 
The average pixel pixel grey value _MATH_ of the first image is scaled such that _MATH_, which means that on the average, the surface section is assumed to be flat. 
A large-scale surface slope of angle _MATH_ in the direction of incident light might be imposed by setting _MATH_--with an absolutely calibrated CCD sensor one might think of deriving such a large-scale slope
At the mean values of the explanatory variables, the estimated hazard of university enrollment for a high-school graduate in the sample in a given year is 35.1%. 
The cumulative probability of enrollment after five years is estimated to be 70%. 
These numbers do not significantly differ from official statistics, which report an average annual university enrollment rate of 37% of a German high-school graduate and reveal that 75% of the graduates enroll within five years of leaving high-school (Statistisches Bundesamt, _CITE_). 
_CITE_ estimate very similar probabilities on the basis of a non-structural model of university enrollment, also using SOEP data.
The matrix elements of the partial transpose matrix are given by: _MATHDISP_.
As the core purpose of SAPDS is to ensure fine-grained access control over the cloud-based storage system, which ensures that at any quantum of time all of the keys circulating among users must confirm the policy associated with the hosted data. 
This policy enforcement requires that as soon as user is revoked all of the user must update their decryption keys cornering off the revoked user.
Let assumption _REF_ hold and let the convergence condition _REF_ be satisfied. 
Furthermore, let there exist a closed domain _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_
Let _MATH_ be the arc length between starting point _MATH_ and general point _MATH_. 
A curvature definition has to be independent of the speed (or rate of evolution) _MATHDISP_ of the parametrization of _MATH_. 
Curvature is now formally defined by _MATHDISP_ at point _MATH_ of a smooth Jordan curve _MATH_.
In case 1 of Fig. 4 there are only a roll and a hinge; they impose constraints to the macroscopic displacement only at the marginal points of the bottom side. 
At the same points analogous null values are prescribed for _MATH_. 
Macroscopic tractions are prescribed only in the raised part (see Fig. 4) and microtractions are prescribed to vanish on the same part.
After some calculation one gets _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
A circular optical cell, suitable for multipass direct absorption, wavelength modulation and resonant photoacoustic techniques for sensitive trace gas measurements is presented. 
Its performance is demonstrated by the quantitative measurements of CO_MATH_ and N_MATH_O at ambient concentrations. 
Noise equivalent one second precision of 2.7ppb and minimum absorption of _MATH_ with 250s averaging for _MATH_CO_MATH_ are achieved with the DA, whereas the one second precision of 4.3ppb and minimum absorption of _MATH_ with 450s averaging are determined for the WM technique. 
With PA, a normalized noise equivalent absorption (NNEA) of _MATH_ is achieved. 
Sensitivity, (isotopic) selectivity and realtime spectral fitting of up to 200 makes this instrumentation attractive for many applications, including Eddy covariance flux measurements, breath air analysis, and industrial process and environmental monitoring. 
Future development will include more compact and integrated optics, thermal stabilization, customized electronics and improvements in the design for industrial production.
Consider the case when _MATH_ is the segment _MATH_ with usual Lebesgue measure. 
Let _MATH_ is the function on _MATH_ that it is equal to 0 for _MATH_ and is equal to _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_, and the sequence _MATH_ is a fundamental one in the norm (_REF_). 
But their limit function _MATH_ does not exists among measurable and summable functions. 
Such a limit is the Dirak function _MATH_ that is equal to 0 for every _MATH_ and is equal to infinity at _MATH_ (with the normalization agreement that _MATH_).
The derivation of parton to hadron fragmentation function in QCD medium based on first principle calculation is not done so far. 
This can be relevant at RHIC and LHC heavy-ion colliders to study hadron production from quark-gluon plasma. 
Further complication arises because the partons at RHIC and LHC may be in non-equilibrium.
From the above dispersion relation, we obtain two branches for _MATH_ defining the resonant frequencies of the _MATH_ polariton excitations which are clearly separated into a high-frequency, _MATH_, and a low-frequency, _MATH_, for each _MATH_. 
In the particular case, when the speed of light can be taken to be infinitely large, i.e. _MATH_, we find the following dispersion relation for the coupled SP modes: _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, are the squares of the SP dispersion on the cylinders _MATH_ [20,21], with _MATH_, whereas _MATHDISP_, describes the electrostatic interaction between the two concentric nanotubes.
Exercise 9: Template matching is performed on the image in figure _REF_ with the template T1. 
Normalized cross correlation is used. 
What is the output value at position _MATH_?
Proof. 
Similar to the proof in Theorem _REF_, when _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_), if conditions (C1) and (C2) hold at _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_-) and _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_) for some _MATH_, then a Hopf bifurcation occurs at _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_).
For any matching M and any vertex cover VC of _MATH_, _MATH_ as each edge can only cover one edge of M. 
In a bipartite graph _MATH_, the requirement for a vertex cover is the same, it should cover all edges of _MATH_. 
In such a graph, maximum cardinality of a matching is equal to the minimum cardinality of a vertex cover _CITE_.
The nonlinear energy sink is designed by means of a small mass _MATH_ attached to mass _MATH_ with a pure cubic geometric nonlinearity in parallel with a linear viscous damper. 
A quick glance at Fig. _REF_ allows to notice that the NES is physically attached to a body of mode 2 and far away from the node of mode 1 which practically means that it is able to resonate with both modes. 
NES mass is chosen such that _MATHDISP_ corresponding to a mass ratio _MATH_ and _MATH_.
To end this subsection we recall one property, useful in the sequel, concerning the space _MATH_, where _MATH_ denotes the subset of _MATH_ of _MATH_-periodic functions - namely the space _MATH_ is separable and dense in _MATH_.
Quasicrystals are intrinsically quasi-periodic alloys. 
They display icosahedral symmetry in three-dimensions and penthagonal symmetry in the plane so that they do not fall within the standard crystallographic classification (see, e.g., [ScvS]). 
Quasi-periodicity is assured by creation and annihilation of atomic clusters with symmetries different from the prevailing one. 
Atomic rearrangements (the so-called phason activity) then occur randomly throughout the body (see, e.g., [DYHW]) and influence the gross behavior. 
Locally they can be described by a vector _MATH_ which collects degrees of freedom within each crystalline cell. 
Quasicrystals do not display peculiar substructural inertia associated with the phason activity and the elastic energy density does not depend on _MATH_ while it depends only on its spatial gradient _MATH_ besides the gradient of macroscopic deformation. 
Moreover, quasicrystals are characterized by a self-action of dissipative nature (i.e. by phason dissipation inside each material element).
These are all examples of statistical studies that require automated feature recognition tools to detect events on all scales (usually spanning over several orders of magnitude) with equal reliability and objectivity. 
Although even automated detection schemes can have their own bias (e.g., selection criteria or instrument-dependent temperature sensitivity), they can be corrected using quantitative knowledge of the bias effect (e.g., using Monte-Carlo simulations to quantify selection criteria, or instrumental response functions to correct for temperature bias).
Finally we present the generalized result to the generalized beam splitting case:
We consider a gravitationally-stratified solar atmosphere that is described by the ideal two-dimensional (2D) MHD equations: _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_ is mass density, _MATH_ is the flow velocity, _MATH_ is the magnetic-field, _MATH_ is the gas pressure, _MATH_ is the temperature, _MATH_ is the adiabatic index, _MATH_ is the gravitational acceleration, where _MATH_ m s_MATH_, _MATH_ is the mean particle mass, and _MATH_ is Boltzmann's constant. 
Throughout this article, we use the Cartesian coordinate system with the vertical axis denoted by _MATH_ and the horizontal axis _MATH_. 
Henceforth, we assume that the medium is invariant along the _MATH_-direction with _MATH_ and set the _MATH_-components of plasma velocity and magnetic-field equal to zero, i.e. _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The latter assumption removes Alfven waves from the system but still allows magnetoacoustic-gravity waves to propagate freely.
The randomness and ergodicity properties of the chaotic map are used to search an optimal solution within a constraint area _CITE_. 
In _CITE_, _CITE_, the chaotic optimization or called chaotic research was applied in PSO to avoid the premature phenomenon. 
In this paper, Tent map as a kind of chaotic map is combined into PSO, which can reduce the probability of the premature phenomenon and get a more satisfactory rational approximation for the fractional order system.
(I) Delay Hopf bifurcation and stability of the equilibrium: 
For system _REF_ with parameters _REF_, conditions (B3) and (B4) hold at _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Hence, a family of stable (supercritical) periodic orbits bifurcates from the equilibrium _MATH_ when _MATH_ by using Corollary _REF_. 
In addition, Theorem _REF_ assrets that the equilibrium _MATH_ is asymptotically stable when _MATH_ and unstable when _MATH_. 
The dynamics is shown in Fig. 2. 
We only displays the solution evolves from the constant initial value _MATH_ close to _MATH_.
Example 4: 
Let us consider the following time-fractional initial boundary value problem: _MATHDISP_ where the boundary conditions are given in fractional terms.
As it can be seen, the verification problem boils down to only two operations: i) distance calculation and ii) comparison against a threshold. 
As soon as an efficient protocol is available to perform these two tasks, a secure protocol for pattern verification can be built. 
In order to do so, it is necessary that the privacy requirements are defined. 
Though many different scenarios are possible, in most of the cases the requirements of the protocol can be defined as follows (see also the summary in Table _REF_): _MATH_ gets yes/no.
How much of this variance is actually due to the country versus the firm level? 
This question can be answered by means of an analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
There, we use a design matrix of indicator variables (country and other dummy variables) to exactly decompose the total variance in AETR, EMTR, and EATR into its components. 
We suggest a model which reads _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the corresponding effective tax rate in country _MATH_, NACE 4-digit industry _MATH_, size class _MATH_, and year _MATH_. 
The index _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_ refers to firms. 
_MATH_ is the constant of the model; _MATH_ is the parameter for the effect specific to country _MATH_ (e.g., capturing the importance of country-specific effective tax rates); _MATH_ is the parameter for the value of _MATH_ specific to industry _MATH_; _MATH_ is the parameter for the value of _MATH_ specific to size class _MATH_; _MATH_ is the parameter for the value of _MATH_ specific to year _MATH_; and _MATH_ is a remainder component which is not attributable to either countries, industries or size classes. 
Anything that is not contributed by countries (and the constant) should be captured by _MATH_. 
We may refer to the total variance in _MATH_ as _MATH_ and to the partial sums of squares of the country, industry, size-class, and time effects as _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, respectively. 
The residual sum of squares of that model is _MATH_. 
In an ANOVA as in Eq. (_REF_), _MATH_, and _MATH_ is referred to as the 'model' sum of squares. 
Consequently, _MATH_ is the 'residual' sum of squares.
A point _MATH_, and the corresponding annulus _MATH_ are non-essential if there exists a hyperplane supporting the convex hull of _MATH_ and containing all faces tangent to _MATH_. 
Otherwise, the point _MATH_ and the corresponding annulus _MATH_ are essential.
To test whether the horizontal- and vertical-flow components are separated by the measurements of _MATH_ and _MATH_, a simulation was done using a flow model identical to model g2 of Article I. 
The solar model used is the convectively stabilized one described above and a Cartesian simulation is done using the SPARC code (_CITE_,_CITE_; _CITE_). 
500 features identical to the flow in model g2 are placed randomly in the horizontal plane. 
Center-annulus and quadrant travel-time differences are measured as described above. 
The horizontal spacing of the simulation is _MATH_ with _MATH_ pixels. 
The maximum depth is _MATH_. 
The attempt was to go as deeply as possible in order to be able to use large distances. 
In order to be able to put the 500 features over the entire horizontal field and still be able to obtain full annulus coverage for large separations, the horizontal periodicity of the simulation was used in the travel-time computation.
Lemma 1 If _MATH_ is upper (lower) semicontinuous and compact-valued, then so is _MATH_.
. (i) Obviously, _MATH_ is a root of the Eq. (_REF_) if _MATH_. 
For (ii) and (iii), it is enough to use the lemma (_REF_). 
Note that if we take _MATH_ as bifurcation parameter, then differentiation _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_ leads to _MATHDISP_. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ at critical value of the time delay are _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
These relations use in the section 4.2 in order to study the Hopf bifurcation for the system (_REF_).
Taylor Linearization. 
Consider the nonlinear system defined by (_REF_), for which the whole operating domain _MATH_ has been partitioned into a number of _MATH_ local operating regions such that _MATH_. 
A multi-model of (_REF_) can then be obtained by combining local linear approximations of (_REF_) on _MATH_. 
To this end, let _MATH_ be a family of _MATH_ operating points; for instance each operating point can be defined as the center of the local region _MATH_. 
For sufficiently small variations _MATH_ and _MATH_ of the variables _MATH_ and _MATH_ around the _MATH_ operating point, the linear (in fact affine) approximation of (_REF_) is obtained via the first order Taylor series expansion of the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ at _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ where the variations _MATH_ and _MATH_ are defined as _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
In the case where _MATH_ is a set of equilibrium points, i.e., _MATH_, the local approximations (_REF_) become linear with respect to the variations _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In this case, we have _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_ 
In the more general case where _MATH_ includes some off-equilibrium points, the local approximations (_REF_) are rewritten as follows _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ are defined as in (_REF_), and the constant vectors (or bias) _MATH_, _MATH_, are given by _MATHDISP_ 
A seen in section _REF_, to each local model is associated a validity function _MATH_ that is close to one when the current vector _MATH_ belongs to the region _MATH_ and tends to zero outside _MATH_. 
The multi-model is then obtained by taking the weighted average of the local models, where the weights are the validity functions, i.e., _MATHDISP_ which can also be written as a convex combination of the local models _MATHDISP_ Consider a continuous stirred tank reactor whose schematic diagram is shown in figure _REF_.
Bivectors provide a natural way of representing rotations using a minimal set of parameters. 
It is possible to specify any finite rotation in a unit plane, defined by the unit bivector _MATH_, and through an angle _MATH_, using a rotation bivector; _MATHDISP_
A white noise with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 20 dB, is added to the Comsol output signal to simulate measurement noise. 
A model between the integrated input _MATH_ and the noisy output _MATH_ is identified. 
The quality of this identification is quantified using the _MATH_ norm of the output error on the identification data: _MATHDISP_, and on the validation data: _MATHDISP_. 
By analogy with rational systems, the numerator order is fixed to the denominator order minus the commensurate order: _MATH_, with _MATH_. 
Then, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are evaluated for different values of _MATH_ and reported in table _REF_.
Setting _MATH_, we have the following lemma. 
Assume the formula _MATHDISP_ holds for some constant _MATH_, let _MATH_. 
Then the solution _MATH_ yields to the following problem _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ satisfies the inequality _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is constant which independent on _MATH_. 
Proof. 
Noting that _MATHDISP_, we can derive the following estimates from (4.8) _MATHDISP_. 
From Lemma 2.1, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, from the Poincare inequality, combining (4.12) and (4.4)-(4.5), we conclude that _MATHDISP_.
Remark 5. 
In practical application, the chaotic behavior in PMSM is undesirable since it can destroy the stability of the motor even make the drive system collapse. 
So the control is implemented as soon as the motor is driven to avoid the chaotic behavior. 
The last 3 figures are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
It has been shown experimentally that a kinesin with a sufficiently long neck linker is capable of taking steps of varying lengths (variable-length stepping) including backward steps _CITE_. 
After the motor takes a large step, the tension between the heads, which is dictated by the properties of the neck linker domain, will be larger, resulting in different kinetic rate constants than for uniform-length stepping. 
While the previous model for neck linker extension _CITE_ was insufficient for describing variable-length stepping, there have been previous examples of variable-length stepping especially when considering myosin motors. 
Specifically, Kolomeisky and co-authors have explored variable-length stepping by a modification of a finite-state periodic model that allows for closed form solutions _CITE_. 
In addition, these previous works have incorporated explicit spatial forces that could include the effect of a freely diffusing head. 
Other models that incorporated variable-lenght stepping includes Shaevitz et al _CITE_ who explored variable-length stepping by analyzing the step-time distribution. 
The present method differs by handling a relatively more complex model of the constrained diffusion of the free head at the expense of the explicit formulas found in this previous work. 
As both myosin and dynein naturally take variable-length steps, there is a broad need for this type of model to properly interpret single-molecule experimental data _CITE_.
For a vertex _MATH_ of _MATH_, assume that its corresponding vertex in _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
Let the increment of corresponding _MATH_ be _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_. 
For an edge _MATH_ of _MATH_, assume that its two end vertices are _MATH_. 
Then the new edge point _MATH_ of _MATH_ is defined as (See Fig. _REF_(a)) _MATHDISP_. where _MATH_ are the tensor parameter of _MATH_ used to adjust the shape of the interpolation surface.
(Autocorrelation in NDARMA Processes) Let _MATH_ be an NDARMA(_MATH_) series as introduced in the definition _REF_, and let _MATH_. 
Then we have _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
In particular, _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be a local ring. 
Assume _MATH_ and _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
Then there is _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Consider the PSLG _MATH_ given as input for the quadrilateral meshing step, that is, edges and vertices in _MATH_ are shared by triangles from different regions of the partitioned mesh (or they are incident to image boundary edges). 
Recall that each edge in _MATH_ is a constrained edge, which we call a _MATH_-edge. 
The goal of the boundary simplification step is to simplify the polygonal curves defined by the set of all _MATH_-edges and their vertices. 
To do that we used a well-known line simplification algorithm _CITE_. 
This algorithm can only handle simple, open polygonal curves. 
However, the set of all _MATH_-edges defines polygonal "curves" that are not necessarily simple nor open (i.e., they are closed and may form T-junctions). 
So, we preprocess the set of all _MATH_-edges in order to define a set of maximally longer, simple , and open polygonal curves (see Figure _REF_(a)), and then execute the aforementioned line simplification algorithm on the resulting curves.
The longitudinal experimental friction factor is calculated using (_REF_) at different temperature range of measurements. 
The density of helium is calculated at the average CICC temperature and pressure. 
_MATHDISP_ Where, L is the length of the sample CICC, i.e., 7 m and the velocity of the fluid in the CICC (V_MATH_) is calculated using the following equation _MATHDISP_ Where, the volumetric flow rate in the CICC (_MATH_) is calculated by dividing the mass flow rate by the corrected helium density at the CICC average temperature and pressure.
We estimated the dynamical age of N10 using the model described by Dyson and Williams _CITE_ with a given radius R as: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the sound velocity in the ionized gas (_MATH_) and _MATH_ is the radius of the Stromgren sphere given by _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the number of ionizing photons emitted by the star per second, _MATH_ is the original ambient density, and _MATH_ is the hydrogen recombination coefficient to all levels above the ground level. 
Here we adopt a Lyman continuum photon flux of about _MATH_ (Watson et al. _CITE_) and a radius of 1.61 pc. 
For that no CO cores look like swept by expanding HII region on the border of N10, it is difficult for us to estimate the original ambient density of N10. 
Massive star formations usually take place in the giant molecular clouds and the densities of the giant molecular clouds are about _MATH_ to _MATH_ (Goldsmith. 
_CITE_). 
So it seems to be safe for us to assume the low value of original ambient density of N10 is about _MATH_ and obtain a lower bound on the dynamical age,about _MATH_ yr. 
Taking into consider that stars are formed in the dense clumps of the giant molecular cloud, the true original ambient density may be larger than that we assumed, the true dynamical age of N10 should be larger than _MATH_ yr.
In this section we deal with the optimization algorithm developed in order to calculate the ASN Minimax plan _MATH_ and _MATH_ when _MATH_ is known or unknown, respectively. 
These plans are determined by the five parameters _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
They have to meet the two inequalities (19) and to minimize the objective function _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ given by (2). 
For _MATH_ known and _MATH_ unknown the ASN function _MATH_ is given by formulas (19) and (24) in Feldmann/Krumbholz (2002) and by (18), respectively. 
The critical value _MATH_ does not occur within _MATH_. 
But since all of the five parameters occur in the OC, we have to solve a mixed non-linear optimization problem (MINLP) with five degrees of freedom.
Such a descriptor is suitable for our Fast Reject framework, it works directly on polygon meshes without conversion, and experiments (see Section _REF_) show its effectiveness for nearly isometry-invariant part in whole matching. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates the search space reduction induced by the fast reject schema when implemented based on the Gaussian curvature descriptor.
Suppose that _MATH_. 
Then via (2.50) _MATHDISP_ or _MATHDISP_ Substituting the general solution _MATH_ of (2.52) into (2.50) and (2.51) we obtain two equations for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ and two homogeneous linear dependent equations for _MATH_ and _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ 
Via (2.54) _MATHDISP_ Substituting the first equality (2.55) into (2.53) and excluding _MATH_ we obtain _MATHDISP_ Multiplying the numerator and the denominator of the obtained fraction by _MATH_ one can convert (2.56) to the form of the first line in (2.43). 
Note that the same result can be obtained using the second equality (2.55).
Remark Consider the generalized cap with all heights zero. 
Then _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and the Hessian vanishes identically. 
If we put _MATH_ for all _MATH_, where _MATH_ for all _MATH_, then _MATH_ and thus defines a cap _MATH_. 
It is easy to find a polyhedral disk _MATH_ such that the graph _MATH_ is disconnected. 
This example shows that the points of degeneration of the Hessian might be non-isolated.
Now, we give the convergence formalism of the sequence of boundary controls _MATH_. 
First, we recall that the sequence of Borel measures _MATH_ weakly converges to Lebesgue measure _MATH_. 
Let _MATHDISP_ be any bounded sequence; that is, _MATHDISP_. 
We say that a bounded sequence _MATH_ is weakly convergent if there exists an element _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
In this section, we compare the prediction of Equation (_REF_) with observed results. 
_CITE_ analyzed in-situ data obtained with Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft. 
This is an extension of the previous work of _CITE_ over a time period of seven years. 
They separated the data obtained inside likely ICME from the SW. 
The three criteria for ICME are: high _MATH_ to proton density ratio (_MATH_), high O_MATH_ to O_MATH_ density ratio (_MATH_), and low proton _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
The data points which satisfy the three ICME criteria defined the likely ICMEs. 
The data points satisfying at least one of the criterion, or taken within one day of satisfying a criterion, define the possible ICMEs. 
The selection of the possible ICMEs is broad enough that we can be confident that most of the ICMEs have been selected, so that the remaining data are from the SW (called non-ICME).
However, majority of these algorithms result in an unstable filter. 
Although various methods have been proposed to tackle the instability problem yet their practical implementation suffers from a very small stability margin [15]. 
The applications of evolutionary computation techniques to the design of digital IIR filters have been investigated in [15-18]. 
The results reported in [15-18] suggest that modern search heuristics are more efficient in the filter design problem. 
In [15] and [16] the authors propose a Neural Network (NN) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach to the recursive filter design. 
However, the computer language GENETICA [17] was able to outperform the above mentioned algorithms. 
Recently Das et al. [18] formulated a new variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (MEPSO) for the purpose. 
In this chapter we focus on the application of an improved version of a recently proposed meta-heuristic namely, Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO).
We now suppose that the conditions (ii) or (iii) in the lemma (_REF_) hold, then the system (_REF_) has a pair of purely imaginary roots _MATH_ at the critical value of time delay _MATH_.
In Step 8 of Algorithm _REF_, _MATH_ or _MATH_ is obtained. 
The value of _MATH_ has only partial information about _MATH_. 
The remaining part of the scalar might be obtained using an exhaustive search. 
The latter involves two main steps: (i) solve a system congruences with a test candidate and the known part of the scalar (Step 11.2.1), and (ii) perform a scalar multiplication to verify if the solution of the system of congruences is the desired scalar (Step 11.2.2).
Consider the _MATH_-channel nonuniform transmultiplexer of Fig. _REF_. 
As discussed in Section _REF_, if we block the input and output signals, a multi-input multi-output _MATH_ by _MATH_ LTI system results.
The porous medium is a stationary random log-conductivity (_MATH_) field, of mean _MATH_ (the geometric mean), variance _MATH_ and isotropic two-point covariance _MATH_. 
Although the procedure can be formally extended to anisotropic structures, we focus here on the simpler isotropic case, as most of the conclusions of this work do not depend on anisotropy. 
The auto-correlation _MATH_ has a finite linear integral scale _MATH_, which is assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the flow domain and of the solute plume.
There exist some real numbers _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, such that: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
The topic of geometric nonlinearity is very popular in structural mechanics. 
In recent years, considerable work has been devoted to the formulation of models, for two or three-dimensional elastic structures, for cases of small strains in the large displacements regime. 
Large-scale calculations required by these formulations have encouraged the adoption of simpler and faster elements and efficient treatments of the finite rotations. 
Typically, definitions of lower-order quadrilateral or hexahedral isoparametric elements are the most suitable provided that we overcome the associated locking problems in the cases of thin structures.
If only a finite set of equivalence classes of items is given, a dense set of latent traits _MATH_ is required to define a dense probability. 
In such a case, probability _MATH_ is defined for any _MATH_, but it could be theoretically assumed to hold also for all those _MATH_ that do not have a corresponding value _MATH_. 
For these values, the condition of antysimmetry _MATH_ does not hold, thus leaving to constraint _MATH_ a certain freedom out of the set _MATH_. 
In particular, the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are not necessarily equal. 
It has been shown that in such a case Equation _MATH_ decomposes into a set of equations, one for each constant _MATH_, leading to a scale that is somewhat weaker than an interval scale. 
When items are such that all the differences _MATH_ are multiples of some real value _MATH_ (so that ratios of differences are rational), the admissible transformations _MATH_ are not uniquely defined; but the interval properties still hold for an infinite set of many equally spaced points on the latent continuum. 
The transformation instead is affine if there are some _MATH_ such that the ratio _MATH_ is irrational _CITE_. 
The same result has been found for additive conjoint measurement _CITE_. 
More generally, it has been shown that when such an asymmetry between _MATH_ and _MATH_ exists, and restricted or unrestricted solvabilty is defined with respect to a single attribute, any order of cancellation axiom is required for an additive conjoint representation to exist, but uniqueness is weakened as previously discussed _CITE_. 
It appears that if the structure of a latent trait can be hypothesized to be rich enough, it makes up (although not completely) for the finite number of equivalence classes of item characteristics, thus closing the scale to an interval one while yielding a continuous probability. 
Indeed, the higher the cardinality of _MATH_ and the smaller the spacing between the values _MATH_, the less freedom is left to the constraint and hence to the admissible transformation _MATH_ _CITE_.
Tadj and Choudhary _CITE_ deal with an _MATH_ queue where service is offered in batches of fixed size. 
Interruption takes place to ongoing service with the duration of interruption and that of an uninterrupted service having arbitrary distributions. 
Embedding at successive service completion epochs, the authors analyze the problem. 
The authors mention that Choudhary and Deka _CITE_ provide a survey of the work on queues with interruption, which we believe to be far from being complete. 
That paper discusses an _MATH_ retrial queue with two phases of service. 
The server is subject to breakdown and consequent repair. 
In contrast Tadj and Choudhary _CITE_ provide an exhaustive survey of the work done in optimal control and design of queues wherein they mention a few works on queues with service interruption.
Corresponding statistics about computing times are shown in table _REF_. 
These remain well below 1 sec, but show less stability. 
But this is rather due to the diversity in the size of the instances as will be seen in the more detailed sensitivity analysis in section _REF_ where we look at the effect of changing the number of production units.
The generally accepted method of nonlinear geometrical acoustics ignores the additional term _MATH_ as it is small. 
However, it is the term that is responsible for wave deceleration due to the amplitude damping. 
Besides, estimations within the framework of the perturbation theory suggest that the ray pattern variation due to nonlinearity is a correction of the same order of magnitude that the nonlinear variation of the wave amplitude is. 
It is therefore important to take this into account in the nonlinear geometrical acoustics approximation.
In this paper, we consider the particular instance of the above problem when _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The machines running at speed 1 are said to be fast and are denoted by _MATH_, while the machine having a speed _MATH_ is slow and is denoted by _MATH_. 
When _MATH_ and machine _MATH_ has a job of size _MATH_, we assume that the completion time of this job on _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
Since our model depends on the parameter _MATH_, for an online algorithm H, we denote by _MATH_ its competitive ratio. 
This model is also interesting in the sense that for a fixed _MATH_, we analyze the system with _MATH_ and _MATH_ identical machines together, by using one machine whose speed can vary continuously from 0 to 1.
In order to measure the fluid mass flow rate in the hydraulic path, a Venturi meter is mounted outside the cryostat, at the main outlet of the CICC as shown in fig. _REF_.
In larger superconductors (the left panel in Fig. _REF_) the fluctuations also increase with interband interaction at higher temperatures. 
In particular, using Landau expansion of the non-equilibrium free energy density _MATH_ in powers of _MATH_ near _MATH_, one can find from Eqs. (_REF_), (_REF_) for macroscopic system _MATH_ which leads to the increase of _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
However, at lower temperatures _MATH_ shows opposite tendency: due to the memory about the lower one-band phase transition the fluctuations will increase with _MATH_ decrease. 
Therefore, the interband interaction redistributes the superconducting fluctuations between different temperature domains. 
The observations reflect the topological peculiarities of the free energy density as a function of non-equilibrium order parameters.
The properties of the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind were substantially different in the unusual solar minimum between Cycles 23 and 24: the magnetic-field strength was substantially reduced, as were the flow properties of the solar wind, such as the mass flux. 
Explanations for these changes are offered that do not require any substantial reconsiderations of the general understandings of the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind that were developed in the Cycle 22-23 minimum. 
Solar-wind composition data are used to demonstrate that there are two distinct regions of solar wind: solar wind likely to originate from the stalk of the streamer belt (the highly elongated loops that underlie the heliospheric current sheet), and solar wind from outside this region. 
The region outside the streamer-stalk region is noticeably larger in the Cycle 23-24 minimum; however, the increased area can account for the reduction in the heliospheric magnetic-field strength in this minimum. 
Thus, the total magnetic flux contained in this region is the same in the two minima. 
Various correlations among the solar-wind mass flux and coronal electron temperature inferred from solar-wind charge states were developed for the Cycle 22-23 solar minimum. 
The data for the Cycle 23-24 minimum suggest that the correlations still hold, and thus the basic acceleration mechanism is unchanged in this minimum.
In the subsystem theory various different subsystems can be applied. 
The most common one is a combination of a motor, an arm and an elastic gear and this paper concentrates on that. 
A subsystem, which describes this unit can be seen in Fig. _REF_. 
There, _MATH_ shows the motor velocity _MATH_ with the gear ratio _MATH_. 
The elasticities in the gears are modeled as torsion springs between the arm _MATH_ and the motor coordinates _MATH_.
This paper investigates in detail the relationships and time delays between CME parameters and sunspot numbers (_MATH_). 
The CME parameters (speed, acceleration, central position angle, angular width, mass and kinetic energy) and the methods used in this paper are described in Section _REF_. 
The linear cross-correlations among the above parameters and their dependencies on _MATH_ are first analyzed in Section _REF_. 
An integral response model _CITE_ is then used to study the relationships and time delays between the CME parameters and _MATH_ in Section _REF_. 
In this model, the output depends not only on the present input, but also on past values. 
In a second step, this model is modified and the relationships between the CME parameters and _MATH_ improve (see Section _REF_). 
Finally, our conclusions are discussed and summarized in Section _REF_.
When the system approaches the bifurcation points, it exhibits some interesting features not existent elsewhere in the parametric phase space. 
In order to investigate the system's behavior in the vicinity of the jump points, it is useful to rewrite the slow envelope evolution equation _REF_ as a two dimensional flow _MATHDISP_, where we have defined _MATH_ (i.e., _MATH_), and _MATHDISP_. 
The real-valued noise processes _MATH_ and _MATH_ have the following statistical properties: _MATHDISP_. 
At the fixed points, the following holds: _MATH_. 
A typical phase space flow of the oscillator in bistable regime is shown in Fig. _REF_.
Write _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ are functions in _MATH_ to be determined. 
Then (8.4.33) becomes _MATHDISP_ equivalently, _MATHDISP_ 
We take _MATH_ and redenote _MATH_. 
The above second equation implies _MATHDISP_ 
So _MATHDISP_
In above discussions about the properties of _MATH_ a condition is _MATH_, which is just a requirement for windows.
In _CITE_ it is proved that the Cauchon reduction algorithm provides a bijection between the nonempty cells of _MATH_ and the Cauchon diagrams of size _MATH_. 
Let us give more details about this bijection. 
First, let us recall the following result from _CITE_. 
A real _MATH_ matrix _MATH_ is totally nonnegative if and only if _MATH_, the matrix obtained from _MATH_ at the end of the Cauchon reduction algorithm, is a nonnegative Cauchon matrix. 
This is the content of _CITE_.
Type III beams can also evolve from injection of thermally-heated electrons into the coronal background _CITE_. 
These electrons may have similar spectral forms to the background electrons, such as the Maxwellian distributions commonly assumed ( e.g., _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_). 
Here we discuss _MATH_ emission produced in a new simulation, S5, where the injected energetic electrons have _MATHDISP_, replacing _MATH_ in Equation (_REF_). 
Here _MATH_ is Maxwellian at a flare electron temperature _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
In S5 we set _MATH_ MK (corresponding to a strong flare), while all the other parameters ( e.g., _MATH_) are identical to S4, which assumes power-law injected electrons and a kappa background plasma. 
The characteristic parameters of S5 and its prediction for _MATH_ are shown in Table _REF_.
Proof of (_REF_): 
We have _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ _MATH_. 
Hence _MATHDISP_.
Let _MATH_ be the set of non-negative real numbers, _MATH_. 
Is _MATH_ well-ordered?
In order to obtain the stability criterion for STSFNNs with time-varying delays and reaction-diffusion terms. Based on the piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, we partition the variable space _MATH_ by the boundaries: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes the set of the face indexes of the polyhedral hull and _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We partition the variable space _MATH_ into _MATH_ independent polyhedral hull _MATH_, _MATH_ which satisfies _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the set of subspace indexes.

Convergence characteristics of the neural network approximation process
In these figures, we list the contributing reflection (_MATH_) and transmission (_MATH_) amplitudes. 
The _MATH_ subscript distinguish an up step from a down step while the tilde represents reflection and transmission for an incoming wave from the right. 
The prime terms correspond to spin flip amplitudes. 
In the next section, we also give the results of the continuity equations for the barrier.
Let _MATH_ be a Lie group. 
A map _MATH_ has two types of tangent vectors, _MATH_ and _MATH_
The observations indicate that magnetic energy in the molecular clouds is comparable to the gravitational energy (e.g., Crutcher 1999). 
Moreover, the magnetic fields are also theoretically believed to play an important role in gravitational collapse of the molecular cloud cores. 
They provide pressure support against the gravity and carries away angular momentum prior to and during the collapse of cores to form accretion disks, jets and protostars (e.g., Machida 2010). 
Although, in a molecular cloud core, the spatial configuration of magnetic field lines is not simple (e.g., Whittet 2005), but polarimetry observations of young stellar objects suggest that circumstellar thin disks around the young stars have approximately aligned perpendicular to the magnetic fields (e.g., Pereyra et al. 2009). 
Here, we consider a simple initial configuration in which the magnetic fields are assumed to be parallel with rotational axis of core. 
Since the molecular cloud cores are lightly-ionized, the ambipolar diffusion in which the magnetic field is frozen into the charged species and drifts along with them through neutrals, is an important mechanism (e.g., Adams 2009). 
Thus, we consider the effect of magnetic fields directly on charged particles, while the neutral species feel them indirectly via the collisions with ions.
Positive and negative fluxes are well correlated, nevertheless their difference [_MATH_] (flux imbalance or net flux) shows regular changes closely connected with the phase of the 22-year solar cycle. 
The smoothed value of the difference [_MATH_] for the northern hemisphere is shown in Figure _REF_. 
Maxima of the difference amount to _MATH_ % of the average magnetic flux for the northern hemisphere. 
Wolf numbers are shown for comparison with the solar-cycle progression. 
The difference varies with the 22-year cycle and reaches extrema during maxima of solar activity. 
It should be noted that the difference is close to zero for several years around minima of solar activity (_MATH_ and _MATH_). 
During these periods the difference passes through zero. 
Thus, from one minimum to another the sign of _MATH_ (the difference between positive and negative fluxes) does not change. 
In Figure _REF_ the sign of leading sunspots in bipolar sunspot groups is shown. 
One can see that the sign of the difference coincides with the sign of leading sunspots in the northern hemisphere. 
Evidently, the leading sunspots give a greater contribution to the magnetic flux than the following ones.
In Chapter 2, we use the method of sub- and sup-solutions to prove the following result. 
If _MATH_, then for any _MATH_, there exists a unique solution of _REF_. 
As was mentioned above, the existence part of this theorem has been established by Terracini et al in _CITE_. 
They used the Leray-Schauder degree theory, but did not give the uniqueness of solutions. 
We also note that, although the application of the method of sub- and sup-solutions to nonlinear elliptic systems has a long history and is well known (for example, see _CITE_), problems similar to _REF_ has not been treated through this approach. 
In fact, the method of sub- and sup-solutions can not be used to give existence results for the general Lotka-Volterra competition system. 
However, in our case by utilizing the special structure of _REF_ and a simple observation, we can get the existence and uniqueness of solutions at the same time. 
Note that here the symmetric assumption _MATH_ is crucial for this method.
As the Hardy space _MATH_ is, by definition, a closed subspace of the space of _MATH_, the latter space may be decomposed as the orthogonal direct sum _MATHDISP_. 
The corresponding projection operators are precisely the Cauchy transforms _MATH_ since it can be directly verified that _MATHDISP_. 
The analytic signal _MATH_ and the anti-analytic signal (_MATH_ thus possess a monogenic extension to _MATH_ respectively. 
Note that the Hardy space _MATH_ and its orthogonal complement _MATH_ are nicely characterized by means of the Hilbert and Cauchy transforms: 
A function _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_, or _MATH_, or _MATH_. 
A function _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_, or _MATH_, or _MATH_.
A decade later two seminal papers of Lanczos from 1950 and 1952 _CITE_ and a paper of Hestenes and Stiefel from 1952 _CITE_ changed the history of iterative methods by inventing the Lanczos method and the method of conjugate gradients (CG) for solving partial eigenvalue problems and systems of linear algebraic equations respectively. 
To be precise, Lanczos invented a family of methods, including the method mathematically equivalent to the bi-conjugate gradients method (Bi-CG) described about 20 years later by Fletcher. 
The methods of Lanczos, Hestenes and Stiefel orthogonalize (in principle, not in practical computations) the sequence (4), and the corresponding recurrences are mathematically equivalent to a three-term recurrence for orthogonal polynomials. 
Moreover, the optimality properties of these methods, which nowadays are often expressed in terms of projections, can be related to Gauss quadrature and moment matching. 
Lanczos, Hestenes and Stiefel were well aware of these connections. 
In Sections 14-18 of their paper, Hestenes and Stiefel described them in detail and with full clarity. 
They present the link to the Gauss quadrature of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral defined by the symmetric positive definite matrix _MATH_ and the given initial vector _MATH_, as well as the link with continued fractions and with their partial fraction representation (_REF_) determined by the eigenvalues of _MATH_ and the size of the projections of _MATH_ in the corresponding invariant subspaces; see also the work of Ljusternik published in 1956 _CITE_.
Therefore, the Kalb-Ramond field is related to the torsion potential. 
This is in accordance with the usual interpretation of the Kalb-Ramond field _MATH_ in the low energy string theory as the non-Rimannian theory _CITE_. 
In our case torsion is an infinitesimally small constant.
The Second Fundamental Form: 
Given a parametric surface _MATH_ and its normal vector _MATH_, if we define the quantities _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ then the second fundamental form _MATH_ of the surface is the quadratic expression defined as, _MATHDISP_.
Assume first that the bands of the system are non degenerate, that is _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
As a consequence an element _MATH_ in the kernel of the commutator satisfies _MATHDISP_ that is : _MATHDISP_ 
Since the beginning, we have assumed that all the functions involved are regular in _MATH_ and have a series expansion in this parameter (as well as in the canonical variables). 
Thus, iterating the last relation for _MATH_ yields that, for each _MATH_ expanded as a series expansion in _MATH_, at each order in _MATH_, _MATH_. 
As a consequence, the kernel of the commutator with _MATH_ is null and we can thus formally write _MATH_ under the form : _MATHDISP_ where we have defined : _MATHDISP_ and the inverse of the commutator operation _MATH_ satisfies obviously : _MATHDISP_ 
If the Band are degenerate, we need to define the inverse of the commutator more carefully. 
Actually since some bands may be degenerate, the kernel of the commutator _MATH_ has no reason to be null now. 
This operator is thus no more bijective and we will not be able to define its inverse uniquely. 
This non uniqueness will lead to a non unique definition of _MATH_. 
This is not astonishing. 
Actually, when the Band are degenerate, as in the Dirac case, we do not look for a diagonal Hamiltonian, but rather for a Block diagonal Hamiltonian. 
This leaves thus more freedom for the diagonalization process and as a consequence, for the definition of _MATH_. 
Practically, we proceed as follows. 
Decompose our space of non diagonal matrices of operators denoted _MATH_ in the following way. 
Write _MATH_ with _MATH_ an arbitrary supplementary space of _MATH_. 
Now, given _MATH_ an element of _MATH_, chose a antecedent _MATH_ of _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_, and decompose _MATH_ with respect to the previous decomposition, _MATH_ where _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Now set _MATH_. 
Given a chosen decomposition _MATH_, _MATH_ is unique since if _MATH_ is another antecedent of _MATH_, _MATH_ and as a consequence _MATH_ is the decomposition of _MATH_.
On the other hand, when _MATH_ holds. 
Let _MATH_. 
It can be easily checked that _MATH_ is a concave and increasing operator satisfying _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
By similar arguments as in the case of (i), we can get the conclusions of this Theorem. 
(Yihong Du, _CITE_) Assume that _MATH_ is a normal solid cone, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ is an increasing operator. 
Suppose one of the following assumptions holds:
According to (8.1.15), (8.1.61) and (8.1.89), _MATHDISP_ 
By (8.1.15), _MATHDISP_ 
Then (8.1.11) and (8.1.93) say that _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
Once _MATH_ is derived, _MATH_ is encrypted with CP-ABE under access structure _MATH_ substituting the value of _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
Legitimate user must possess _MATH_ to update the existing legitimacy attribute, as illustrated in Fig. _REF_. 
Since, cloud server can team up with the revoked user to decrypt the outsourced data, to overcome this problem, _MATH_ is not directly sent to the cloud server. 
Instead of that, owner constructs a new access policy _MATH_, encrypts _MATH_ with CP-ABE under _MATH_, and uploads it to the cloud server. 
_MATH_ specifies that legitimate user can decrypt _MATH_ except from the recently revoked user(s). 
Owner then sends the PRE encrypted public key component _MATH_ of the legitimacy attribute, along with _MATH_ to the cloud server. 
Availability of the owner is no longer required, from onward cloud server can manage the key update process without compromising data privacy. 
Algorithm _REF_ illustrates the process of updating the secret component of the _MATH_.
We also show that this new factorization of _MATH_ leads to a new factorization of the Operational-Space Inverse Inertia, _MATH_, in the form of a product involving sparse matrices. 
We show that this factorization can be exploited for optimal serial and parallel computation of _MATH_; that is, a serial algorithm with a complexity of _MATH_ and a parallel algorithm with a time complexity of _MATH_ on a computer with _MATH_ processors.
It is well known that the double transversely polarized DY process _MATH_ allows to directly extract the transversity distributions (see Ref. _CITE_ for review). 
However, at the same number of collected DY events, the double spin asymmetries suffer from the much more large statistical errors (product of the beam and target/beam polarizations in the denominator) than the single spin asymmetries. 
This is especially important for the double-polarized DY processes with _MATH_ (as well as with _MATH_ and _MATH_) collisions, where because of the small value of transversity PDF for the sea antiquark in proton (neutron), the double spin asymmetry is estimated to be a few percents maximum _CITE_. 
Thus, in the case of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ collisions we focus on here, the double polarized DY processes seem to be not too useful and we need an alternative possibility allowing to extract the transversity PDF from the combined analysis of unpolarized _MATHDISP_, and single-polarized _MATHDISP_ DY processes. 
Besides, namely unpolarized and single-polarized DY processes give us also an access to Boers-Mulders and Sivers PDFs, which are very intriguing and interesting objects in themselves. 
On the other hand, in the processes (_REF_) and (_REF_) the access to PDFs we are interesting in is rather difficult since they enter the respective cross-sections _CITE_ in the complex convolution with each other, so that at first sight it is impossible to avoid some models on the _MATH_ dependence of PDFs. 
To solve this problem the _MATH_ weighting approach _CITE_ was recently applied in Ref. _CITE_ to Sivers effect in the single-polarized DY processes (_REF_), and in Refs. _CITE_ with respect to transversity and Boer-Mulders PDF extraction from both unpolarized and single-polarized DY processes (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
In two last cited papers we considered the DY processes with antiproton-proton and pion-proton collisions. 
At the same time the DY processes with the proton (deutron)-proton (deutron) collisions are also very important since they provide the access to sea PDFs. 
Within this paper we will estimate both types of single-spin asymmetries (SSA), which give us respectively access to Sivers PDF _CITE_ and to transversity and Boer-Mulders PDFs _CITE_. 
At first sight it seems that DY processes with proton (deutron)-proton (deutron) collisions are strongly suppressed because there is no valence antiquark in the initial state there. 
However, we will see that there exist the kinematical regions where both SSA take quite considerable values.
In 1991, Levi _CITE_ considered the following equation: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ satisfies some growth conditions and _MATH_. 
The author reduced the system to a normal form and then applied Moser twist theorem to prove the existence of quasi-periodic solution and the boundedness of all solutions. 
This result relies on the fact that the nonlinearity _MATH_ can guarantee the twist condition of KAM theorem. 
Later, several authors improved the Levi's result, we refer to _CITE_ and the references therein.
The value of _MATH_ is fixed through the amplitude of _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, with the effective lagrangian _MATHDISP_, we can directly connect _MATH_ to the branching ratio _MATHDISP_, and therefore (for the numerical evaluation, we will use the central value only) , _MATHDISP_.
_CITE_ 
Suppose that _MATH_ is a row-stochastic matrix with positive diagonal entries. 
If the directed graph of _MATH_ has a directed spanning tree, then _MATH_ is SIA.
Now, we need to bound _MATH_. 
We have, _MATHDISP_. 
Using Remark _REF_, we obtain _MATH_.
The performance of all these estimators crucially depends on the accuracy of the (generalized) Pareto approximation in _REF_ (respectively _REF_ in the case _MATH_) and the choice of the threshold _MATH_. 
Too low a threshold will lead to a large bias, because the GPD approximation is inaccurate for the smallest exceedances of _MATH_. 
On the other hand, if _MATH_ is chosen too large, then the estimators use only a very small fraction of the whole sample and thus their variance will be large. 
In Section 4, we will discuss methods to deal with the bias-variance tradeoff in greater detail.
In the five dimensional Kaluza Klein (KK) theory there is a well known class of static and electromagnetic-free KK-equations characterized by a naked singularity behavior, namely the Generalized Schwarzschild solution (GSS). 
We present here a set of interior solutions of five dimensional KK-equations. 
These equations have been numerically integrated to match the GSS in the vacuum. 
The solutions are candidates to describe the possible interior perfect fluid source of the exterior GSS metric and thus they can be models for stars for static, neutral astrophysical objects in the ordinary (four dimensional) spacetime.
Parallel connection of all-pass sub-filters exhibits low sensitivity and allows standard low-pass, high-pass and band-pass (band-stop) filters to be realized with arbitrary number of bands _CITE_. 
This approach can be modified and applied on design of IIR notch filters.
The following result has been proved for the adjoint problem (_REF_) for _MATH_ in _CITE_ or _CITE_ and for _MATH_ in _CITE_: 
For all _MATH_, the observability inequality (_REF_) holds uniformly as _MATH_ within the class of initial data _MATH_ in the adjoint problem (_REF_). 
One of the possible proofs of this result is based on a dyadic decomposition argument like in _CITE_. 
For the case _MATH_, it reduces to show that the total energy of solutions corresponding to initial data in _MATH_ can be uniformly bounded from above by the energy of their projection on the first half of the spectrum. 
The second step is to use the uniform observability inequality (_REF_) in the class _MATH_ consisting of discrete functions for which the second half of Fourier modes have been truncated; this result can be obtained by the multiplier technique (cf. _CITE_) or by Ingham-type inequalities (cf. _CITE_). 
For the quadratic case _MATH_, the projection on the first half of the acoustic mode has to be implemented to reduce the proof of Theorem _REF_ to the observability inequality (_REF_) on the class _MATH_ of functions for which the second half (the high frequency one) of the acoustic diagram and the whole optic diagram have been truncated. 
The fact that for _MATH_ the bi-grid algorithm in Theorem _REF_ essentially truncates _MATH_ of the spectrum versus only _MATH_ for _MATH_ can be intuitively seen in the fact that _MATH_ involves two requirements on its elements versus only one requirement for _MATH_. 
The observability time for these two bi-grid algorithms coincides with the continuous optimal one _MATH_, since the group velocities _MATH_ and _MATH_ are increasing functions on _MATH_ and then _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and similarly for _MATH_. 
Thus, the minimal velocity of propagation involving solutions with data in the class _MATH_ for both _MATH_ and _MATH_ is equal to one.
Therefore the regression error with extent of _MATH_0.14 W m_MATH_ (see green curve, Figure 4) also provides the uncertainty with which we can measure that there is no change of solar minimum TSI during cycle 23. 
Such a conclusion implicitly assumes the used proxy indices - spots, faculae, and the chromospheric network - are the main responsible for TSI variability even in between solar minima. 
Nevertheless a possible change in the TSI level between minima can arise from non-magnetic origin such as a change in the effective temperature combined with diameter changes. 
Such effects if they exist could explain part of the residuals of the model or trend within the limit of instrumental stability (around 100 ppm).
The preceding two lemmas can be combined to show our main result for KEMs. 
If _MATH_ is _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_secure then _MATH_ is _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_secure. and, we get that there exists an adversary _MATH_ (from), such that for any given adversary _MATH_ and any _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a polynomial upper bound on the number of decryption queries that _MATH_ makes. 
Since both _MATH_ and _MATH_ are negligible by assumption, this proves the theorem.
For the count model, means and intervals were again similar between the two approaches (Table _REF_). 
However, slight discrepancies in means for count model coefficients existed which might have been due to that the best model from the two-stage approach contained the additional covariate year and/or to Monte Carlo error. 
Further reasons are discussed in section _REF_. 
Also, measures of uncertainty were again mostly smaller for the Bayesian approach: standard deviations from the Bayesian approach were smaller for all covariates in the count model compared to BSEs. 
95% credible intervals were narrower for all coefficients of the count model compared to 95% confidence intervals, except for the covariate Julian day where they were equal. 
95% credible and confidence intervals overlapped for all count model parameters. 
The only covariate selected for the preferred count model for the two-stage approach that was not also in the preferred model for the Bayesian approach was year. 
95% confidence intervals for both year coefficients included zero indicating that this covariate might have been negligible for the count model.
A 30 kW, 100 rpm prototype generator is planned to be built to prove the concept. 
In order to find the most feasible superconducting wire, three different options have been examined; YBCO, MgB2, BSSCO. 
Among these wires, the least expensive one is MgB2 wire. 
On the other side, it needs to be cooled down below 39 K, which increases the cost of the cooling system. 
Second generation (2G) wires (e.g. YBCO) are more expensive but has a higher critical temperature. 
Nitrogen-based cryocoolers may be used, which are more robust and less expensive. 
But, the performance of the 2G wires is highly dependant on the field incidence angle. 
Thus, a detailed analysis of the flux penetrating into the superconducting wire is required.
For the "only if" part, given that _MATH_, use _MATH_ from Lemma _REF_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Substituting: _MATHDISP_, hence _MATH_ is a Perron vector of _MATH_.
To prove this, observe that the total reward of a balanced partition is _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_.
We would like to repeat the procedure described in the last paragraph for several different values of _MATH_, thereby learning both _MATH_ and _MATH_ modulo several different _MATH_ values. 
We can then imagine being able to reconstruct both _MATH_ and _MATH_ using the CRT as per Section _REF_. 
However, before this approach can work, we must deal with two difficulties: First, the procedure as described above will not yield residues of _MATH_ and _MATH_ modulo relatively prime integers since _MATH_ divides _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Second, in the worst case (e.g., if _MATH_), we will not be able to determine which residues modulo each _MATH_-value correspond to _MATH_ versus _MATH_. 
If we mismatch residues from _MATH_ and _MATH_ during our CRT based reconstruction we could obtain a potentially huge number of bogus frequencies. 
The following procedure, inspired by work from _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_, circumvents both of these difficulties.
On the other hand, there exists a distinguisher that achieves the advantage governed by the statistical difference. 
The key observation is that determining the value _MATH_ for which the maximum _MATH_ is achieved can be done by a computationally unbounded distinguisher given _MATH_ and _MATH_ without using its oracle (in fact, it can even be done in polynomial space). 
The main point here is that _MATH_ and _MATH_ can be computed in probabilistic polynomial time, so in particular there is polynomial bound on the amount of random coins each uses. 
Consequently for each _MATH_ we have that _MATH_ can be computed (in finite time). 
The maximum can be computed exploiting that _MATH_ (and hence _MATH_) have a finite domain. 
Now consider the distinguisher that, on input _MATH_ and _MATH_, first determines the _MATH_ that maximizes _MATH_ and queries _MATH_ to its oracle. 
When it gets a response _MATH_ that would have been more likely to have originated from _MATH_, or _MATH_ it outputs 1, when _MATH_ was more likely to have caused _MATH_ it outputs 0; when both were equally likely it flips a coin. 
In this case the advantage is equal to _MATH_.
The situation of this paper is that the Stokes equation for the compressible viscous fluid flow in the upper half space is coupled via inhomogeneous interface conditions with the Stokes equations for the incompressible one in the lower half space, which is the model problem for the evolution of compressible and incompressible viscous fluid flows with a sharp interface. 
We show the existence of _MATH_-bounded solution operators to the corresponding generalized resolvent problem, which implies the generation of analytic semigroup and maximal _MATH_-_MATH_ regularity for the corresponding time dependent problem with help of Weis' operator valued Fourier multiplier theorem. 
The problem was studied by Denisova _CITE_ under some restriction on the viscosity coefficients and one of our purposes is to eliminate the assumption in _CITE_.
5gfxWeller-Chap6/Weller-Fig6-30 Scenario II, maximum running-time in the happy buddha sceneresbuddha2
Let us state the problem more precisely. 
Assume that we have a real-valued random process _MATH_, measured along the closed and bounded interval _MATH_. 
Assume that there are _MATH_ different conditions which may affect the process, and that _MATH_ have been measured _MATH_ times under each of those conditions, giving the sample _MATH_. 
Assume also that for every _MATH_, there exists a (nonrandom) function _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ are random functions centered in mean (i.e., _MATH_ for every _MATH_). 
Our aim is to test the hypothesis _MATH_.
The whole Sections I.6, I.7 in _CITE_ and Sections II.4, II.5 in _CITE_ are devoted to semi-periodic continuous functions, called there limit periodic functions (cf. also _CITE_). 
This class was shown there to be identical with the one of uniformly almost-periodic functions with one-term _MATH_-base and, in case of integral one-term base, it reduces to the one of purely periodic functions. 
For some more references concerning limit periodic functions, see e.g. _CITE_. 
In fact, limit periodic functions were already considered by Bohr in 1925, as pointed out in _CITE_.
The automated detection of curvi-linear structures in the solar corona is most useful for 3D reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field with stereoscopy (e.g., Feng et al. 2007) and for testing theoretical magnetic field models (e.g., potential fields, linear, or nonlinear force-free fields, etc.; DeRosa et al. 2009; Sandman et al. 2009), because they represent independent tracers of the magnetic field.
Therefore, according with Chapter 3, the control problem can be mathematically stated as follows: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_ is time, _MATH_ is a bounded control action and _MATH_, _MATH_ are smooth functions. 
The control task is to keep _MATH_.
As noted earlier, the microwave spectral index is detected using only two channels of 17 and 35 GHz. 
It is not possible to use the 80 GHz to do spectral fitting. 
Although we increase the signal/noise at this channel by integrating for a longer time interval, the high level noise makes the flux at 80 GHz greater than that at 35 GHz except for several sub-peaks for the 13 December 2006 flare. 
On the other hand, it is not sure that the emission at 17 GHz is purely optically thin during this event, especially at the time of sub-peak 3 and the decay phase of sub-peak 10 as shown in Fig. 3. 
In other words, it is possible that there is an optically thick component, which heavily affect the spectral fitting. 
Such effects on the microwave spectral index cannot to be ruled out from the NORP observations.
The answer to the above question is critically important for many practical problems, but to answer the question in our context of general complex systems is far from obvious. 
For example, there is this well-known phenomenon of "finite escape" (i.e. solutions blow up in finite time) when _MATH_ is a highly nonlinear system. 
An elementary example of this kind is the scalar system _MATH_ with external input _MATH_. 
Clearly, the zero-input system _MATH_ is globally exponentially stable, and thus RGAOS. 
However, for any arbitrarily small constant input _MATH_, some solutions blow up in finite time. 
Indeed, for any initial condition _MATH_ such that _MATH_, and for _MATH_, the associated solution _MATH_ goes to _MATH_ as _MATH_.
Same as the method proposed by Yang _CITE_, we compute normal vector to every vertex as a weighted average of normals of its neighboring triangles. 
Suppose that _MATH_ are the triangles (for other types of polygon, we define triangles by consecutive edges shooting from the vertex) sharing the vertex _MATH_. 
For each triangle _MATH_ we assume the angle at the vertex _MATH_ is _MATH_ and the normal of the triangle is _MATH_, then the normal at the vertex _MATH_ can be estimated as _MATHDISP_.
Unfortunately, any stochastic EM-type algorithm that can be designed for the hidden Markov model given by Proposition _REF_ leads to a non-explicit M-step as well. 
For this reason, a numerical maximization procedure of quasi-Newton type, should be implemented at each iteration. 
For a large dimensional parameter vector this could be rather time consuming and may lead to convergence towards local maxima. 
_CITE_ propose to separate a complicated M-step into smaller, more tractable conditional M-steps and update step by step the parameters of the model. 
This is the principle of the ECM (Expectation Conditional Maximization) algorithm, which is an interesting extension of the classical EM-algorithm. 
The ECM can also be used when we consider stochastic variants of the EM. 
In our setting we can benefit from this principle since we can reduce the number of parameters to be updated via numerical maximization by updating explicitly in a first CM (conditional maximization) step a large number of easily tractable parameters with fixed values of the rest. 
We describe this idea in the deterministic setting for notational simplicity since in the stochastic case we just have to replace all the smoothing functionals with their estimated counterparts.
Assume that _MATH_ is an evenly spaced grid on the real line with a distance between grid points of _MATH_. 
We represent an approximating Markov chain for _MATH_ using the tridiagonal transition matrix, _MATH_, with elements _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the drift and _MATH_ is the diffusion coefficient, which should be constant in this case of Brownian diffusion in a potential. 
We use the approximating Markov chain rates found in _CITE_, but there are alternatives including one commonly used for motor models, the WPE method _CITE_.
The compression function _MATH_ of _REF_Grostl-256 uses two _MATH_-bit permutations _MATH_ and _MATH_, which are similar to the two _MATH_-bit permutations _MATH_ and _MATH_ used in the compression function _MATH_ of _REF_Grostl-512. 
More precisely, for a chaining value _MATH_ and a message block _MATH_, the compression functions (_REF_) produces the output (_MATH_ denotes the XOR operation): _MATHDISP_.
Classical cascade control can yield improved response of the system to load changes. 
Kaya's _CITE_ improved cascade control system, a conventional cascade control scheme combined with Smith predictor, is shown in Fig. _REF_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ describes the plant dynamics. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ are the PI/PID type controllers whereas _MATH_.
We recall that (_REF_) or (_REF_) is said to have property _MATH_ if every nonoscillatory solution _MATH_ of the equation satisfies _MATHDISP_ for large _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_. 
This property _MATH_ demands that Eq. (_REF_) or (_REF_) or (6.46c) should admit a nonoscillatory solution (in both cases, viz., _MATH_ and _MATH_). 
Theorem 2.1.8 gives the existence of a nonoscillatory solution of (_REF_) with _MATH_, and one may refer to Section 2.7 for the existence of a nonoscillatory solution of (6.46c) with _MATH_. 
In fact, Lemma 2.7.3 shows that (6.46c) with _MATH_ is of _MATH_ and hence it admits a nonoscillatory solution. 
Hence it is interesting to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of nonoscillatory solutions of (_REF_) or (6.46c) with _MATH_. 
If one proceeds as in Lemma 1.4.2, it can be proved that if _MATH_ is a nonoscillatory solution of (6.46c), then either _MATHDISP_ or _MATHDISP_ holds for large _MATH_. 
This property remains true when _MATH_, that is, _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ is a solution of (_REF_), if and only if _MATH_ is a solution of (6.46c). 
We can use the Definition _REF_ to Eq. (6.46c), where the operator _MATH_ is given in (_REF_). 
We define them here again. 
Equation (_REF_) (either _MATH_ or _MATH_) is said to have property _MATH_, if every nonoscillatory solution _MATH_ of the equation satisfies (_REF_) for large _MATH_. 
Similarly, Eq. (6.46c) (either _MATH_ or _MATH_) is said to have property _MATH_, if every nonoscillatory solution _MATH_ of the equation satisfies (_REF_).
As we all know, the long-term survival of some or all interacting species in an ecosystem is a very important concept of population dynamical systems. 
Mathematically, this is equivalent to the so-called persistence or permanence of the populations. 
Roughly speaking, we say a species _MATH_ is persistent if _MATH_, and we say a system is persistent if all its populations are persistent. 
A system is called uniform persistence if all involved populations will eventually have densities larger than some positive constant; if in addition, these populations are also bounded, then we say the system is permanent. 
The study of persistence and permanence for nonautonomous population dynamical systems of functional differential equations has received much attention, see [1,2,10-14,18,24-26,28,29,34-39,41-44,46,47] and the references cited therein. 
Tang and Kuang in _CITE_ discussed the following Kolmogorov-type systems of nonautonomous functional differential equations, _MATHDISP_ 
By using _MATH_ Liapunov-like functionals, the boundary of the permanence region were established, and as applications of these results the permanence criteria for the delayed nonautonomous _MATH_-species Lotka-Volterra type competitive systems and two-species Lotka-Volterra type predator-prey systems were obtained. 
Li and Teng in _CITE_ studied the permanence for general nonautonomous population dynamical systems of functional differential equations. 
By improving the research method given in [34], a more general result on the permanence was established and as applications of this result the permanence criteria for the general delayed nonautonomous _MATH_-species Lotka-Volterra type food chain systems were established.
The essential aspect of the Gunn approach, is to use two homogeneous (i.e. 1D up) spaces, instead of one. 
These are denoted _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Their formal definitions are that _MATH_ is the projectivised exterior algebra of _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the projectivised exterior algebra of the dual space _MATH_. 
The latter, _MATH_, is 'Cliffordised' by equipping it with the metric _MATH_, i.e. _MATH_ basis vectors with positive square, none with negative, and one with zero square.
It is only relatively recently, that quantum mechanics allowed to interpret the observed absorption and emission line spectra of stars, their structure, their internal nuclear reactions, and their internal energy transport by radiation or convection. 
What we have learnt is that the life-time of stars is a very strong function of their initial mass, with about two million years reached asymptotically for high masses, and a lifetime longer than the age of the universe at masses about one Solar mass (depicted with a very ancient symbol as _MATH_, which looks similar in Chinese even).
Particularly, for the PEMFC system under study, the bounding values were computed by means of a numerical study of the nonlinear system and refined through an experimental analysis. 
Additionally, uncertainties were included in representative parameters such as the motor inertia, torque friction, humidifier volume and cathode air constant. 
Under the effect of an appropriate control action (a feedforward, as in Chapter 4, proved to be suitable) to lead the system to the vicinity of the desired air mass flow, the following values were obtained: _MATHDISP_
By expression the sums of products of Apostol-Bernoulli polynomials in terms of the special values of multiple Hurwitz-Lerch zeta functions at non-positive integers, we obtain the sums of products identity for Apostol-Bernoulli numbers which is an analogue of the classical sums of products identity dates back to Euler for Bernoulli numbers.
For the number density of created particles we have _MATHDISP_. 
The total number of created particles can be written then in the form _MATHDISP_. 
Consequently we have _MATHDISP_. 
By doing integration over _MATH_ we get _MATHDISP_. 
We see that the factor _MATH_ can be obtained also from _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, This effect seems to be important for light particles. 
However, this is not true. 
Since _MATH_ in equation (_REF_) is Gaussian with respect to _MATH_ we find that particle creation is significant in the time interval _MATHDISP_. 
In radiation dominated universe, electromagnetic backgrounds can be considered quasi-stationary only for short time _MATH_. 
This gives _MATHDISP_. 
The effect of electric field is then more important when the mass of created particles verifies the condition_MATH_. 
Thus, electric field predominantly produces heavy particles. 
Furthermore, it is possible to create super-heavy particles with the mass of the Grand Unification scale in the early universe by strong electric field. 
This may have many important cosmological consequences. 
For light particles the effect of the electric field on particle creation is negligible although the factor _MATH_ becomes large when _MATH_ is small. 
This is explained by the fact that, when _MATH_ decreases _MATH_ decreases so that _MATH_ remains negligible.
Lastly, if _MATH_ is enumerated by _MATH_, then there are no _MATH_ or greater marked parts, since each consecutive pair of integers together occur at most _MATH_ times. 
In this case, we can restrict our attention on _MATH_, and _MATH_.
The second example is of an initial configuration with a low-density region of cells on the right side of the domain. 
Snapshots of the time-evolution for this configuration are shown in Fig. _REF_. 
In this case, most cells reach the required threshold to start moving towards the light source. 
A finger is created in an area where the initial density of cells was relatively high.
The experimental results of disk laser emission and wavelength-switching are shown in Figs. _REF_ and _REF_. 
In agreement with the model calculation, wavelength-switching could be obtained over a range of several FSRs by appling a voltage of several kV at _MATH_ Hz. 
The minimum wavelength step requires 1500 V. 
The emitted laser wavelength switches from the original wavelength of 1028.22 nm to the new wavelength of 1028.31 nm, corresponding to one FSR. 
At 2000 V and 3000 V steps of 2 and 3 FSRs are obtained, respectively (Fig. _REF_).
The hyperplane is given by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the number of dimensions over which the hyperplane is defined, _MATH_ for _MATH_ are linear coefficients, and _MATH_ is a constant. 
All points satisfying _MATH_ are labelled as class _MATH_, and all points satisfying _MATH_ as class _MATH_. 
For the purpose of this study, _MATH_ was set to 10, yielding a 10-dimensional hyperplane. 
The linear coefficients _MATH_ and the constant _MATH_ are real numbers chosen from the interval _MATH_. 
A data set was generated according to the procedure described in Section _REF_, where the number of data points, _MATH_, was set to 1000, and the number of environment changes, _MATH_, was set to 10. 
A set of _MATH_ 10-dimensional points, _MATH_, was randomly generated such that _MATH_, _MATH_. 
The hyperplane was generated _MATH_ times by uniformly randomising its coefficients, _MATH_, the constant _MATH_ and the threshold value, _MATH_. 
Target classification of _MATH_ patterns was updated _MATH_ times, and every time the updated patterns were appended to the data set, yielding a data set of 11 000 patterns. 
The size, _MATH_, of the sliding window was set to 1000.
Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA): SL correction to DLA, _MATH_.
This theorem will be proved Subsections _REF_ and _REF_.
As in the first order case, we consider the set of _MATH_-pairs of _REF_, namely, of those pairs _MATH_ with _MATH_ a _MATH_-periodic solution of _REF_. 
A _MATH_-pair _MATH_ of _REF_ is trivial if _MATH_ and _MATH_ is constant. 
In other words, _MATH_ is trivial if _MATH_ is constant with respect to the moving constraint. 
Again, if _MATH_ is trivial, then _MATH_ must be constantly equal to _MATH_. 
Also, _MATH_, so that the periodicity condition implies that _MATH_ must be constant as well. 
Thus, for all _MATH_, _MATH_ is invariant for _MATH_.
A logical expression to find out who is in love with whom in the Simpsons world (Hint: logical expressions are modeled using axioms, for example hasTemperatureObserviationAxiom).
(1). Set _MATHDISP_. 
Then, for all _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_.
Similarly (using), one can show that for a PHF for _MATH_, _MATH_-programmability implies collision-resistance under the strong RSA assumption. 
We omit the details.
In the next example, we apply the construction of MPCP to a certain concrete TM and see how the match extends itself.
In practice efficient solution methods in the case where the number of parameters is very large are of interest. 
In particular, it would be highly desirable to identify methods which are dimensionally robust, i.e., whose efficiency (meaning accuracy versus computational cost measured in terms of the total number of floating point operations to achieve this accuracy) is provably robust with respect to the number of parameters, i.e., one would like to have complexity estimates and convergence rates independent of the number of parameters. 
Hence our approach consists in directly tackling the case of an infinite (but countable) number of parameters.
Finally, we recall the well known fact that the compensated Poisson random measure _MATH_ satisfies the predictable representation property (PRP) with respect to the filtration _MATH_, i.e. for any locally square integrable _MATH_-martingale _MATH_, there exists a _MATH_-measurable process _MATH_, such that: _MATHDISP_.
For a node _MATH_ in an HHC, _MATH_ is called the subcube ID of _MATH_, and _MATH_ the processor ID of _MATH_. 
We note that the set of nodes having the same subcube ID _MATH_ induces an _MATH_-dimensional hypercube, denoted by _MATH_. 
Also, the set of all subcube IDs induces a _MATH_. 
An _MATH_ is represented in Fig. _REF_ where _MATH_ is induced by the nodes of subcube ID 0000, and all subcubes induce a _MATH_.
We denote _MATH_ by _MATH_. 
For any real matrix _MATH_, there always exist two invertible matrixes _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is transformed into the second equivalent form _MATH_ with _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the number of finite dynamic modes. 
Besides, _MATH_ is denoted by _MATH_ which is partitioned as _MATH_.
The effective theory (_REF_) is defined on the nongeometrical space _MATH_ where the second coordinate _MATH_ is the T-dual of the first effective coordinate _MATH_. 
It is interesting to find the equation of motion of the theory of this type, when _MATH_ is arbitrary function of _MATH_ and _MATH_ consists of the odd powers in _MATH_-odd variable _MATH_.
Pearlitic steels, as all iron-carbon alloys present a marked yield point that needs to be accounted for. 
Therefore, a temperature dependent yield surface is included in the model.
In situ Bioinspired Synthesis of Silver Chloride Nanocrystals on Silk Fibroin Fibers
In order to illustrate the procedures derived in Sec. _REF_, we evaluate the main parameters of slow envelope dynamics of the 125long beam in a particular case in which _MATH_ and the excitation voltage amplitude is 140. 
The quality factor of the beam, as measured in the linear regime, is _MATH_.
Four active regions have been studied: AR NOAA 10720, 10486, 9077 and 8100 whose evolution is shown in Figure 1. 
For each AR one powerful flare which is with good observation and occurred when the AR was nearest to the central meridian has been selected to study the relationship between the distribution of _MATH_ and the location of flare kernels. 
Figure 2 shows the vector magnetograms after projection correction (the first column) and the horizontal velocity vectors superposed on MDI longitudinal magnetograms (the second column) for each AR around the beginning times of the selected flares. 
The capital letters in each panel mark the sites of the flare kernels shown in Figures 3 - 6. 
We see that in some of these sites the strength of the magnetic fields are high or the velocities of the magnetic footpoints are large or both.
During the 1940s, the logical and practical approaches to computation became increasingly intertwined. 
From the war years onwards, Turing contributed to the development of various machines in Britain, and in the United States von Neumann was centrally involved in the planning and construction of new machines, starting with the EDVAC in 1944. 
After 1950, it became common to describe electronic digital computers as being instantiations of Turing's concept of a universal machine, and stored program computers are to this day described as being based on the 'von Neumann architecture'.
A definite advantage of the graph-based perturbation approach developed here lies in the fact that we have obtained an approximation for _MATH_ which is cheap to evaluate for varying values of the system parameters once the (non-dimensional) parameter _MATH_ has been fixed. 
By contrast, any numerical solution of the CME can only give an approximation for fixed values of both _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Similarly, our approximation can easily be evaluated at any point in time, which allows us to avoid a time-step discretization and, hence, the resulting error that is necessarily incurred by numerical integration techniques. 
Compared with SSA, on the other hand, our approach benefits from the fact that it is not Monte-Carlo based, i.e., that no repeated sampling is necessary to achieve the desired level of accuracy; rather, the quality of our approximation can be improved instantaneously simply by taking the parameter _MATH_ to be sufficiently small.
Key distribution assists the data owner to overcome the problem of guaranteed availability. 
As _MATH_ is subject to change after each user revocation, it is distributed to the legitimate users via cloud server. 
Considering _MATH_ legitimate users, the computational complexity of key distribution for the cloud server would be _MATH_. 
Once key is received user verifies the signature of response, making its complexity _MATH_. 
Secret and transformation keys are transmitted to the individual users on successful completion of the subscription process, thus marking its complexity _MATH_ for owner. 
However, one important point which must be considered that secret and transformation keys are exchanged only once. 
After that secret key is updated via cloud server.
Let the sampling rate of the output of the synthesis part of the NTX be _MATH_. 
The sampling rate of the _MATH_-th channel, _MATH_, is given by _MATHDISP_. 
In a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, the outputs at any given frequency are only dependant on the inputs at the same frequency. 
In an LPTV system, the alias-component (AC) matrix relates the inputs to the outputs in the frequency domain. 
For a _MATH_-periodic system, the outputs at frequency _MATH_ are dependent on the inputs at the frequencies _MATH_, where _MATH_ _CITE_. 
As will be discussed, the periodicity in an NTX results in an interesting generalization of the frequency response of periodic systems.
The equation _MATH_ has exponential type transcendental terms, it brings infinitely many characteristic roots. 
The stability can be examined by the Nyquist criterion. 
The Nyquist criterion _CITE_, _CITE_ denotes that all the roots of _MATH_ have negative real parts if and only if the Nyquist plot of _MATH_ does not encircle the origin of the complex plane and it has at least one root with positive real part if the Nyquist plot encircles the origin. 
For example, there are two values _MATH_ of the response amplitude corresponding to _MATH_ in Fig._REF_. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates that the response corresponding to _MATH_ is stable and _MATH_ unstable. 
The numerical simulations in Fig. _REF_ confirm that the stability analysis is valid.
Besides this rough estimate of the modulation index, we also measured it with the help of a high-resolution interferometer. 
For this, the light was guided by the optical fiber in a more high-Q Fabri-Perot interferometer (length is about 50 cm, the input mirror is a plain one, the output mirror is the concave one with the radius 1 m) (Fig. _REF_). 
The interferometer (_MATH_ MHz and _MATH_) allows registration of the FM light spectrum with resolution of about 1 MHz. 
In order to obtain spectrum of the laser field one has to apply a periodical saw-toothed signal at the piezoceramic plate controlling position of the diffraction grating of the external laser resonator. 
This leads to the periodical, linear in time variation of the laser frequency generation _CITE_. 
The photodiode at the exit from interferometer measured the transmitted light power. 
The registered dependency of the photodiode voltage vs time reflects the dependency of the intensities of the different modes in the FM-spectrum from their frequencies. 
For the measured experimentally spectrum we then fit the value of _MATH_ at which the calculated spectrum has the same intensities relation as in experimental spectrum.
In addition to the expectation, we require the variance of wages to estimate the enrollment model. 
To estimate this variance, we use flexible heteroscedasticity functions of the residual variance from the wage equations. 
Specifically, the natural logarithms of the squared residuals from the wage regressions are regressed on the explanatory variables of the earnings model _MATH_ and the selection terms _MATH_ and _MATH_ to control for selection, separately for graduates and non-graduates: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the error term. 
In contrast with the estimation of a population parameter, this approach allows the predicted second moment of wages to vary not only between graduates and non-graduates but also with individual characteristics and covariates, just like the predicted first moment.
Second Case: _MATH_. 
Assume without any loss of generality that _MATH_. 
We split the sum in _MATH_ as follows _MATHDISP_ Noting that _MATH_, and recalling _REF_ and _REF_, _MATHDISP_. 
By _REF_ and _REF_, _MATHDISP_. 
We then obtain, _MATHDISP_.
At zero age main sequence, the p-mode frequency spectrum is clearly separated from the g-mode spectrum. 
As the evolution proceeds, a _MATH_-gradient develops outside the convective core and a growing peak appears in the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. 
This means that g-mode frequencies increase and become comparable to those of low order p-modes. 
Both frequency spectra interact without actually crossing. 
This is known as the avoided crossing phenomenon _CITE_. 
Mixed modes having a g-mode behavior close to the center and a p-mode behavior in the external layers are the clear signature of the time evolution of the _MATH_-gradient. 
At a given effective temperature, a model computed with overshooting is less evolved (see Section _REF_) so the avoided crossing phenomenon is less pronounced. 
As a result, fewer mixed modes show up in the spectrum of a star computed overshooting. 
Thorough analyses of this phenomenon have been performed with models of _MATH_ Scuti stars clearly demonstrating the presence of an asteroseismic signature of overshooting in the mixed mode properties of the pulsation spectrum (see for instance _CITE_).
Here we analyze and study the behavior of dissipative fluids corresponding to the 1st-order and 2nd-order theories, and plot the numerical results next to the exact solution in case of a perfect fluid. 
In all figures, unless stated otherwise, all quantities are plotted as a function of the similarity variable; the ES-PF is plotted with dotted line, while the numerical solutions at _MATH_ fm/c with thin dashed line and at _MATH_ fm/c with continuous line. 
The upper bound for the bulk pressure is, _MATH_, and the relaxation time is, _MATH_fm/c. 
The ratio of viscosity over entropy density corresponds to small _MATH_ or large _MATH_ values.
Because _MATH_, it follows that Algorithm _REF_ can be computed in _MATH_ time, where _MATH_ is the set of edges of _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the number of polygonal cuts between _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Among all the possible form of DoS attacks, the most dangerous is represented by Distributed DoS attacks, that are described in detail in Section _REF_. 
The distributed nature of this form of DoS makes extremely difficult to defend against it. 
Distributed DoS attacks have often been used to extort money from the attacked financial institution.
The sampling rays are cut into a set of segments by the visual hull. 
As shown in Fig. _REF_, for a segment inside the visual hull, _MATH_ for example, we take the interior auxiliary points distributed evenly on that segment, with the distance _MATH_ satisfying _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a user defined constant. 
An exterior auxiliary point on each side of the segment (near and far from _MATH_) is taken on the sampling ray with the distance _MATH_ to the sampling point, as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
With the sampling points and auxiliary points fairly evenly distributed in the 3D space, the visual hull surface will be surrounded by small sized and well shaped tetrahedrons, which is very favorable for visual hull surface extraction.
The time evolution of the geometrical parameter is obtained as _MATHDISP_, and, the ratio _MATH_ satisfies _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_ determines the ratio of (dark) matter to dark energy density and is of order unity in the present epoch. 
One can also study the time evolution of _MATH_. 
Using _MATH_, it is straightforward to show that in order that _MATH_, we must have _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore the behavior of this ratio with respect to the comoving time depends on the parameters of the model, e.g. for _MATH_ (i.e., when the future event horizon is considered), it is decreasing.
Now, the microstructure noise can be added to the underlying continuous price path. 
The distribution for the noise _MATH_ is taken as in Section _REF_, namely is i.i.d. with a variance _MATH_, and independent from _MATH_. 
Because there is no _MATH_ scaling in the noise, the incoherent term dominates the short term behavior. 
With the noise, the expected variance over one day of the (one-step) returns becomes _MATHDISP_. 
This estimator is studied rigorously by _CITE_, showing that it diverges for _MATH_. 
The last term on the rhs increases with _MATH_, creating the upward bias discussed in the introduction of this chapter, and ultimately the divergence for _MATH_. 
When using high frequency data, the term _MATH_ gives typically the largest contribution to the lhs. 
Its large size emphasizes the necessity for correcting the high frequency noise, but also the difficulty of the task as a large term should be removed. 
Any imperfection in the correction will result in a possibly large error in the estimation of the integrated volatility, in the form of bias or variance.
In practice this results in a limitation of about 1000 independently transformed and animated simple primitives (with dynamic transformations as shown in the previous section) for an interactive frame-rate of about 30 frames per second (all performance figures are given for a state of the art desktop PC with a Quad-Core Intel i7 processor at 2.7GHz, 12 GB of RAM and an nVidia GTX 295 graphics card).
Now, we are going to obtain the solution to Eq. (_REF_) by the use of the method proposed in _CITE_, which was further developed for finite domains _CITE_ and for non-homogeneous problems _CITE_. 
This method leads to a Volterra-type integral equation that relates the local values of temperature and the corresponding heat flux. 
The equation is valid in the entire domain, including the boundaries.
An example of the function pair _MATH_ is _MATH_ in _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a Lipschitzian map with Lip-coefficient _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In the case, the perturbation in _MATH_ can be rewritten as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a Levy process (with Levy measure _MATH_ given by _MATHDISP_, by employing the Levy-Khintchine Theorem (see e.g. Sato _CITE_).
Note that in our optimization problem, not all 31 variables (the components of _MATH_ and _MATH_) are independent. 
On one hand, we have the three algebraic relations given by Theorem _REF_. 
On the other hand, we have eleven more independent algebraic relations given by the steady state equations _REF_-_REF_, _REF_, _REF_-_REF_. 
Consequently, we have 17 independent variables in our optimization problem.
_CITE_ 
The time-invariant set-valued map _MATH_ is upper semicontinuous (respectively, lower semicontinuous) at _MATH_ if, for all _MATH_, there exists _MATH_ such that _MATH_ (respectively, _MATH_) for all _MATH_. 
_CITE_ 
Given _MATH_, the right directional derivative of _MATH_ at _MATH_ in the direction _MATH_ is defined as _MATHDISP_ when this limit exists. 
On the other hand, the generalized directional derivative of _MATH_ at _MATH_ in the direction _MATH_ is defined as _MATHDISP_. 
When they are equal, we call the function regular.
It turns out this problem is related to the question of whether there are weakly holomorphic modular forms with a given principal part. 
A weakly holomorphic modular form is any meromorphic modular form whose poles are supported at the cusps. 
The extended principal part at infinity of a weakly holomorphic modular form _MATH_ is the polynomial _MATH_ such that _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
The extended principal part at other cusps is defined similarly. 
Namely, if _MATH_ is a cusp the extended principal part at _MATH_ is the finite sum of terms in the Fourier expansion around _MATH_ that do not have rapid decay toward _MATH_. 
Additionally, let the principal part at infinity of _MATH_ be the extended principal part of _MATH_ minus the constant term.
Based on the above theorems, we have the following discussions.
Let _MATH_ be a _MATH_-algebra and _MATH_. 
Let us prove that there exists a unique morphism of _MATH_-algebras _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
We define _MATH_ for any nonempty tree _MATH_ inductively on the degree of _MATH_ by: _MATHDISP_. 
This map is linearly extended into a map _MATH_. 
Let us show that it is a morphism of _MATH_-algebras, that is to say _MATH_ and _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Note _MATH_, _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
A very strong correlation is also found with another chomospheric-related index, the Mg ii. 
The Mg ii core-to-wing ratio is derived by taking the ratio of the h and k lines of the solar Mg ii feature at 280 nm to the background or wings at approximately 278 nm and 282 nm. 
The h and k lines are variable chromospheric emissions while the background emissions are more stable. 
This ratio seems to be a robust measure of chromospheric activity, mainly for solar UV and EUV emissions _CITE_. 
At this point, we cannot explain these results, particularly given the fact that the quiet-Sun variation has been removed from the seismic maps; however it provides the possibility of intercalibration between the near-side EUV indices and the seismic index. 
An indepth comparison with longer series and filtering different areas of the seismic maps could help understand these results. 
The actual physical mechanism that produces the phase shift in the observed waves when they propagate through a strong magnetic field is still under investigation.
Instead of deriving the compliance from the PV curve, Hildebrandt suggests to apply sinusoidal inputs instead of steps and he obtains the frequency response of the rubber balloon. 
The author considers the variation of pressure over total volume displacement also as an exponentially-decaying function: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ arbitrary constants, _MATH_ the total volume, _MATH_ the time and _MATH_ the power-law constant. 
The transfer function obtained by applying Laplace to this stress relaxation curve is given by: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ the Gamma function. 
If the input is a step _MATH_, then _MATH_ and the output is given by _MATH_ with _MATH_ the unknown transfer function. 
Introducing this into (_REF_) one obtains that _MATHDISP_ 
By taking into account the mass of air introduced into the balloon, an extra term appears in the transfer function equation: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ the inductance. 
The equivalent form in frequency domain is given by: _MATHDISP_ 
This function describes the behavior of the balloon in a plethysmograph, while undergoing sinusoidal forced oscillations. 
One year later, in 1970, he published the results obtained by identifying such a model on excised cat lungs _CITE_. 
He then suggests to do the PV approximation with a transfer function which has an imaginary part independent on frequency. 
This special property gives a phase angle which decreases slightly with frequency (quasi-constant). 
Playing with these models on the data for the PV curves, he discusses the viscoelastic properties of the rubber balloon versus the excised cat lungs. 
In doing so, he combines several idealized mechanical elements to express viscoelasticity in a mechanical context. 
Some fragile steps are then directed towards concepts of stress relaxation and dynamic hysteresis of the lungs.
In order to establish _REF_, notice first that by Theorem _REF_, we have that _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, considering our proof of _REF_ (in particular, considering _REF_), our goal is to show that, given that for all _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, then it also must be the case that, for any _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
In fact, the statement _REF_ will then clearly follow from the case _MATH_ in _REF_ along with _REF_. 
We apply a (reverse) induction to establish _REF_. 
Notice that the case of _MATH_ in _REF_ is clear.
As before in case of global Lipschitz-continuity of _MATH_ the small-data-assumption _REF_ can be dropped, and we can even allow for an exponential growth of _MATH_ as described by the conditions _REF_ and _REF_.
Optimization-based methods _CITE_ evolve the texture as a whole, further improving the quality of the results and making the synthesis more controllable. 
By defining a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based similarity metric for measuring the quality of synthesized texture with respect to a given input sample, the synthesis problem is formulated as minimization of an energy function, which is optimized using an Expectation Maximization (EM)-like algorithm. 
Wexler et al. _CITE_ defined an energy function for the completion of missing information of the video. 
Kwatra at al. _CITE_ defined global texture optimization for image texture synthesis. 
More recently, Kopf et al. _CITE_ extended global texture optimization method _CITE_ to the task of solid texture synthesis, in addition, Kopf et al. _CITE_ integrated histogram matching in texture optimization, which improved the convergence of the synthesis process and partially addressed the issue that the optimization process could get stuck in a local minimum. 
More recently, different from the traditional texture synthesis, Wei at al._CITE_ presented an inverse texture synthesis method, which used an optimization framework to produce a small texture compaction that best summarized original large globally varying texture.
Now we present results on the generation and observation of coherent excitation of superpositions of the _MATH_ and the _MATH_ states by circularly polarized pulses giving rise to non-stationary ring currents. 
As shown in Fig. _REF_ pulsed coherent excitation with right-handed circularly polarized light induces electronic dynamics on two different time scales. 
On the time scale _MATH_ of the pulse envelope Rabi-oscillations of the population between the _MATH_ and the _MATH_ states occur within the time duration _MATH_. 
These Rabi-oscillations are observed in the AT-splitting of _MATH_ in the photoelectron spectra (cf. Fig. _REF_ and _CITE_). 
In addition, on the time scale of the optical cycle of the driving laser field _MATH_ the electronic wave packet rotates counter-clockwise about the _MATH_-axis. 
The red dots in the electric field depicted in Fig. _REF_ indicate instants separated by a quarter of an optical cycle _MATH_ as. 
The population of the excited _MATH_ state at these instances is shown by the black dots in the upper panel of Fig. _REF_. 
The dynamics of the electronic wave packet at these instances is depicted in the magnification of a single optical cycle in the lower panel of Fig. _REF_. 
Because the non-stationary electronic ring current oscillates at the Bohr-frequency resonant with the exciting laser frequency, the non-stationary nature of this process cannot be directly mapped by a laser pulse at the same frequency. 
However, the measured toroidal shape of the PAD in Fig. _REF_(h)-indicative of the time-averaged non-stationary ring current-together with the AT-splitting-indicative of Rabi-oscillations (cf. Sec. _REF_)-provide experimental evidence of PADs resulting from a non-stationary ring current as illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. _REF_. 
The simpler task to excite a stationary ring current is accomplished by coherent excitation of a _MATH_ state using a circularly polarized _MATH_-pulse. 
Experimentally, stationary ring currents were achieved by reducing the laser intensity such that the pulse area approaches _MATH_. 
Direct time-resolved observations of non-stationary electronic ring currents are within reach employing currently available femtosecond-pump and attosecond-probe techniques _CITE_.
Of particular interest are ambit processes that are stationary in time and nonanticipative. 
More specifically, they may be derived from ambit fields _MATH_ of the form _MATHDISP_. 
Here the ambit sets _MATH_, and _MATH_ are taken to be homogeneous and nonanticipative, i.e. _MATH_ is of the form _MATH_ where _MATH_ only involves negative time coordinates, and similarly for _MATH_. 
Further, we assume that _MATH_ and _MATH_ for all _MATH_.
Proof of Theorem _REF_: 
Following the proof of Theorem _REF_, we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Now, _MATHDISP_. 
This sum is zero unless _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Putting these values, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_ is even. 
Using the Hasse-Davenport relations for _MATH_ and _MATH_ as given in _REF_ and _REF_, we deduce that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Using _REF_ and _REF_ in _REF_, we obtain _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
The equation _REF_ is the same as Eq. _REF_. 
Hence we complete the proof of the theorem following the proof of Theorem _REF_.
Related to the contact models, there are two difficult problems to address in real-time applications, especially when using constant integration time step, which is the case here: the first one is the fact that the contact takes place in a limited, and sometimes very reduced, number of time steps, so that the algorithm has to be robust enough to overcome hard impacts; the second one was mentioned before and is related to the stability of the friction forces at low velocities and the transition between sliping and sticking.
The velocity profiles shown in Figures _REF_ and _REF_ are unusual for EIT waves. 
Constant deceleration (_CITE_ _CITE_; _CITE_), nearly constant speed _CITE_ or irregular velocity profiles _CITE_ were reported for waves observed in H_MATH_, EUV and radio emission. 
But the velocity change we describe here - decelerating nearly to zero after a short propagation and then accelerating again - is observed, to our knowledge, for the first time.
Example. 
Consider a single-server queueing system in which the state variable _MATH_ denotes the number of jobs in the system at each time _MATH_. 
Suppose that a controller wants to control the system's service rate _MATH_ according to the current state _MATH_. 
When the state is _MATH_ at some time _MATH_, the controller takes a service rate _MATH_ from a given finite set _MATH_ of available "actions" at state _MATH_; then the system transfers to another state _MATH_ according to the transition rate induced by the chosen _MATH_, and the process is repeated. 
The choice of service rates is done according to so-called control policies _MATH_. 
If the controller is using a particular policy _MATH_ and the state at time _MATH_ is _MATH_, then the controller takes the service rate _MATH_. 
To be more specific, consider the policy _MATH_ given by _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Hence, when using this policy, if the present state is _MATH_, then the controller chooses the action _MATH_ during the time interval _MATH_. 
Obviously, _MATH_ is measurable in _MATH_, but not continuous. 
Similarly, if _MATH_ denotes the transition rate from _MATH_ to _MATH_ under _MATH_, then the matrix _MATH_ of transition rates when using _MATH_ has elements _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, the transition rates are measurable in _MATH_ but not continuous, and so we cannot use the standard Markov chain theory to show the existence of transition probability functions _MATH_ induced by the discontinuous control policy _MATH_ defined in (1.1). 
An analogous situation occurs in stochastic game problems _CITE_, where discontinuous "strategies" usually lead to discontinuous transition rates. 
This is precisely what motivated our paper-to establish the existence and regularity of a nonhomogeneous transition matrix without requiring the transition rates to be continuous.
Let us look at the dynamics of _MATH_. _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_.
MISA (French acronym for Methode d'Ingenierie des Systemes d'Apprentissage) _CITE_ is an instructional engineering method supporting 35 main tasks or processes and some 150 secondary tasks. 
The method is based on a problem solving approach, comprising six phases: (1) identify the educational problem; (2) define preliminary solution; (3) build learning system architecture; (4) design instructional materials; (5) model, produce and validate materials; and (6) prepare delivery of learning system.
The payoff vector _MATH_ belongs to the equity core associated to _MATH_ i.e. _MATH_.
We are interested in two channel decay of kaon to the pion pairs in the final state, where the pions in the pair can be neutral or charged. 
The well examples are _MATH_ as well as _MATH_ (_MATH_ decay). 
In what follows all quantities relevant to the neutral pions pair (_MATH_) are labeled by index "n", whereas the charged pions pairs (_MATH_-) are labeled by index "c".
The average accuracy in predicting the amplitude of the velocity-peak is generally around 10%, whereas the amplitudes of _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ could be predicted, on average, to about 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively;
We will use the following formula _MATHDISP_, which can be deduced from the fact that _MATH_. 
Thus, _MATHDISP_. 
Notice that _MATH_ because _MATH_ cancels with _MATH_. 
Then _MATHDISP_.
Since the first prediction in 1983 by de Groot et al. of half-metallic (HM) ferromagnetism in the half-Hesuler compounds NiMnSb and PtMnSb, many other systems have been found to be HM ferromagnets._CITE_ 
In 2000, Akinaga and collaborators reported growth of a few layers of CrAs in the mestastable _MATH_ structure for the first time._CITE_ 
In the B3 structure, CrAs was reported to be HM ferromagnetic, with a Curie point higher than 400 K. Afterwards, MnAs, CrAs, and CrSb with _MATH_ structure have been successfully fabricated as nanodots, ultrathin films and ultrathin layers in multilayer._CITE_ 
In 2004, Kusakabe and collaborators predicted that _MATH_ Ca pnictides (i.e., CaP, CaAs, and CaSb) belong to the class of HM ferromagnets._CITE_ 
Then, Sieberer et al. and Volnianska et al. found HM ferromagnetism in many II_MATH_-V_MATH_ _MATH_ compounds._CITE_ Evidence of the growth of such _MATH_ compounds has been provided by Liu et al. who have reported successful self-assembly growth of high-quality ultrathin CaN in the _MATH_ structure on top of Cu (001)._CITE_ 
The complications associated with the aforementioned compounds motivated a large number of scientific research personnel to search for binary HM ferromagnets with simple structures, sufficient magnetic moments, large HM gaps, high Curie temperatures, robust stability of the half metallicity with respect to the lattice deformation, and small mismatch of lattice constants between the predicted HM compounds and correspond semiconductors among both _MATH_ and _MATH_ families._CITE_
PCA is not just a data reduction method. 
By evaluating the scores of the _MATH_-th principal component for an individual (_MATH_-th) data point, _MATHDISP_, we use the two-dimensional distribution of _MATH_ vs. _MATH_ (_MATH_) to reveal peculiarities in the structure of the data, e.g. locate outliers (see Fig. _REF_) or identify clustering. 
Figure _REF_ shows the scores _MATH_ vs. _MATH_ and _MATH_ vs. _MATH_ for the data of Problem _REF_. 
In this case, two-dimensional images of the first few principal components help us clearly separate the good reflections from the bad ones.
Our results - adaptive zero-knowledge proofs. 
All known zero-knowledge protocols for _MATH_ essentially follow the same paradigm: the prover sends the verifier commitments that are based on the statement being proved (and its witness), and the verifier then asks the prover to open part or all of the commitments. 
Based on the prover's answer, the verifier is either convinced that the statement is true or detects the prover cheating. 
It therefore follows that soundness only holds if the commitment scheme used is binding, and this is a problem in the setting of adaptive security. 
Consider an adversary that corrupts the verifier at the beginning of the execution and the prover at the end. 
In this case, the zero-knowledge simulator must generate a transcript without knowing the NP-witness. 
However, at the end, after the prover is corrupted (and the simulator then receives a witness), it must be able to show that the commitments were generated using that witness. 
Until now, this has been solved by using equivocal commitments that can be opened to any value desired (in order for soundness to hold, the ability to equivocate is given to the simulator and not the real prover). 
However, equivocability, needed by the simulator for the 'yes' instances allows an all-powerful prover to break binding and thus soundness on 'no' instances and this means that the protocol has only computational soundness. 
Indeed, the above observation led us to initially conjecture that adaptive zero-knowledge proofs exist only for _MATH_. 
However, our conjecture was wrong, and in this paper we prove the following theorem:
The final step is to obtain an expression for _MATH_ in terms of _MATH_. 
We accomplish this by applying Eqs. (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_) to Eq. (_REF_) as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
On comparing Eq. (_REF_) with Eq. (_REF_), it can be seen that we have obtained a new factorization of the inverse of the joint-space inertia matrix: _MATHDISP_. 
The correctness of this factorization can be proved simply by showing that it is the inverse of the factorization in Eq. (_REF_). 
This is shown in Appendix _REF_.
The genetic fuzzy system with moment based measurement deltas gives a success rate of 100 percent at the noise level of 0.05. 
For a noise level of 0.1, the genetic fuzzy system with moment based measurement deltas gives an average success rate of 98.05 percent and a minimum success rate of 91.4 percent (Slight D/D) and starts falling for higher noise levels of 0.15 and 0.20 by giving average success rates of 96 percent and 89.8 percent, respectively, and minimum success rates of 76 percent and 63.90 percent, respectively. 
The genetic fuzzy system with moment based measurement deltas also gives good performance for the key rules by giving success rate of about 96 percent for rule 7 and success rate of about 100 percent for rule 12, for a higher noise level of 0.15.
Media with effective negative constitutive parameters attract attention for several decades due to unique properties of wave propagation in them. 
In pioneering works of Veselago _CITE_ and Pendry _CITE_ electromagnetic waves in media with simultaneous negative _MATH_ and _MATH_ were considered. 
Since that time, a lot of theoretical and experimental works has been done on this subject _CITE_. 
In fact, for acoustic waves metamaterials are possible too and for them both density and stiffness should be negative. 
Some proposals and experiments to achieve negative effective constitutive parameters for acoustic composites were made in the past, exploiting different techniques, such as: embedding soft inclusions in fluids _CITE_, using Helmholtz resonators _CITE_ and pipe-membrane structures _CITE_.
Figure _REF_ shows the temporal variation of the zonal and the vertical velocity derived from MDI data. 
The values are noisier than the corresponding GONG data due to the small sample size. 
When limited to the same small sample, velocities derived from GONG data are also noisier and differ quantitatively from the GONG results shown in Figure _REF_. 
However, there are qualitative similarities between the MDI and the GONG results shown in Figure _REF_. 
For the vertical component, the downflows decrease with time when flux emerges and turn into small upflows at 13 Mm, while the downflows are getting stronger when the flux decreases. 
The zonal velocity decreases when flux decays. 
The meridional flow remains rather constant (not shown).
In fact, there are a number of ways in which CAS-TSP can be improved in the next step to diminish the iterations of a comparable performance level, and to make its application to larger problem instances feasible. 
Firstly, a local optimization heuristic like 2-opt, 3-opt or Lin-Kerighan _CITE_ can be embedded in the CAS-TSP algorithm to solve the large scale TSPs. 
Secondly, the algorithm is amenable to efficient parallelization, which could greatly improve the performance for finding good solutions, especially for high-dimensional problems. 
From this starting point, we can apply the CAS to other combinational optimization problems such as routing and scheduling. 
These questions remain to be further investigated.
Both types of workers receive material payoff _MATH_ if they work (probability _MATH_) or _MATH_ in the event that they do not work (_MATH_) and the Employer does not monitor (_MATH_). 
For the self-interested worker (type 1), expected utility coincides with expected material payoff _MATH_, which is therefore _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, material payoff for Type 2 worker is _MATHDISP_, while her expected utility includes the preference parameter _MATH_ and is _MATHDISP_.
From the viewpoint of engineering, the active control of mechanical and structural vibrations is superior to the passive control in many aspects. 
However, the presence of unavoidable time delays in controllers and actuators may induce complex dynamic behavior and will limit the performance of the active control. 
In general, time delays play an important role in the dynamic behavior of active control systems. 
Among the current studies on the dynamics of delay systems, the research on periodic vibrations is of special interest. 
To investigate the periodic motions of a dynamic system with time delays, the perturbation methods such as the method of multiple scales, the averaging method, the Lindstedt-Poincare method _CITE_, _CITE_, the asymptotic perturbation method _CITE_-_CITE_ and so on are preferable. 
By means of the method of multiple scales, Hu et al _CITE_ considered the primary resonance and the 1:3 subharmonic resonance of a Duffing oscillator under linear state feedback control with a time delay. 
Using the asymptotic perturbation method, Maccari investigated the parametric resonance _CITE_, _CITE_, the primary resonance _CITE_, _CITE_ of the van der Pol oscillator with a time delay state feedback. 
By means of the averaging method and the multiple scales method, El-Bassiouny investigated the primary and subharmonic resonances of a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system with external and parametric excitations in _CITE_, and also analyzed the qualitative behavior of the response of a ship rolling in longitudinal waves in _CITE_. 
Pankai Wahi et al. _CITE_ employed a Galerkin projection technique to directly obtain a set of a ODEs that would provide excellent finite-dimensional approximations for the dynamics of DDEs. 
In _CITE_, Das et al demonstrated that the multiple scales method could bypass the preliminary center manifold reduction by discarding the rapidly decaying parts of the solution for delay differential equations near Hopf bifurcations. 
They also employed the method of multiple scales to investigate small perturbations of a Harmonic oscillator by a small term with large delay in _CITE_. 
The review article _CITE_ written by Hu and Wang surveyed the recent advances related to the singular perturbation methods to the dynamics and control of time-delay systems including the method of multiple scales, the method of averaging, and two new methods, the energy analysis and the pseudo-oscillator analysis. 
In _CITE_, the validity of perturbation methods, such as the method of multiple scales, the Lindstedt-Poincare method and so on was investigated, and an important observation that the method of multiple scales and the Lindstedt-Poincare method work only for the approximate solutions of the first two orders, and give rise to a paradox for the third-order approximations of the delay differential equations was obtained.
The spectral computations for gyrosynchrotron radiation show the peak frequency of microwave burst can provide information about energetic electrons and their environment in solar flares. 
We find from Section 3 that the peak frequency shifts obviously to higher frequency with increasing number density, low energy cutoff, input depth of energetic electrons, magnetic field strength and viewing angle. 
The peak frequency also shifts to higher frequency as the number density and temperature of thermal electrons increase, but not so obviously. 
While it is independent of the energy spectral index, high energy cutoff of energetic electrons and the upper boundary height of radio source.
In the next section, we explain the events related with the second EB in detail.
Note that the above results on closeness of solutions hold for arbitrarily large compact hybrid time domains and use forward pre-completeness, properties that weaker than stability, of the average system. 
We can get that strong/weak averages approximate well solutions of the original system on compact time domains, where disturbances are required to be Lipschitz and bounded for weak averages whereas only bounded for the strong averages.
Now, consider _MATH_. 
Since, by definition, _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ for some constant _MATH_ that depends only on the parameters of (_REF_). 
Then using a Doob inequality and noting that the quadratic variation of _MATH_ is _MATH_ we can arrive at, _MATHDISP_, where the _MATH_ are constants independent of the SPL. 
A Chebyshev bound and the limit _MATH_ then gives _MATHDISP_. 
The above limit shows that the stopping times _MATH_ may be removed from _MATH_ outside of a set with collapsing probability under the SPL. 
The arguments given in the proof of Lemma _REF_ can be used to show _MATH_ and so we arrive at _MATHDISP_.
Therefore, it is easy to verify that there are no more than _MATH_ different makespan values in the solution space while there are a total of _MATH_ different permutation schedules. 
Since job _MATH_ appears equally before and after _MATH_ in the entire solution space, _MATH_ can be considered as a random variable taking values _MATH_ and _MATH_ with probability 0.5, respectively. 
Obviously, the _MATH_ random variables _MATH_ are independent of one another. 
Then the makespan can be considered as the sum of _MATH_ independent random variables. 
If these _MATH_ independent random variables are from an identical distribution, makespan distribution will be asymptotically normal as _MATH_ according to the classical Central Limit Theorem. 
However, as we don't assume the process times are all drawn from an identical (uniform) distribution, the parameters of _MATH_ (_MATH_ and _MATH_) can be arbitrary. 
Therefore, the distribution of _MATH_ can be different from one other. 
Then the sum of such _MATH_ independent random variables are not guaranteed to be normally distributed. 
In fact, this distribution can be arbitrary as _MATH_. 
Therefore, the makespan distribution of job-dominated PFSPs can be non-normal regardless of the number of jobs.
From the proof of Proposition _REF_ it is apparent that the availability in _MATH_ of the ex-falso rule is needed only to establish condition _MATH_ concerning _MATH_. 
Therefore we have also a proof that if a set of propositional formulae is _MATH_-free, namely it does n't contain occurrences of _MATH_, and it is consistent with respect to minimal propositional logic, then it is satisfiable in classical propositional semantics, so that if a purely propositional formula is _MATH_-free and is deducible in classical propositional logic, then its double negation is deducible in minimal propositional logic.
Before defining our statistical measures, let's give the definitions we will use repeatedly. 
Besides the ones defined in Chapter _REF_, we have the sample variance _MATH_; the sample skewness _MATH_, and the sample kurtosis _MATH_; we assume these to be self-explanatory.
For _MATH_, applying _MATH_ to both sides of the first equation of system (_REF_) and integrating with respect to _MATH_ by parts, we have the identity _MATHDISP_. 
We will estimate the terms on the right-hand side of (_REF_) separately. 
For the first term, by using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Using the above estimate to the second term yields _MATHDISP_. 
Using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Lemma 4.1, we obtain _MATHDISP_.
A last comment, we have made an artificial splitting of the scalar field component into a potential _MATH_ and a kinetic energy density _MATH_ terms, which were associated with the energy densities _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively. 
Basically in this association we have changed the original degree of freedom _MATH_ by the scale factor _MATH_ as can be seen from Eqs. (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
The replacement of the degree of freedom was essential to facilitate the reconstruction process at the begining of this section. 
This is a natural consequence of the interaction model that we have used, moreover, the modeling done in this section and the forthcoming one, where we will deal with the observational constraints, require an explicit scale factor dependence of all magnitudes and principally of the Hubble expansion rate.
We are now in a position to define the class equation of a finite group. 
Let _MATH_ be a finite group and _MATH_ a finite _MATH_-set. 
We now consider the special case of the equation (_REF_) in which _MATH_ and the action of _MATH_ on itself is by conjugation, i.e., for _MATH_, _MATH_ (cf. Example _REF_(iii)). 
Then _MATH_, the center of _MATH_.
Condition 3: Effect of change in estimated coefficients
We first prove that the set of all possible solutions of problem (_REF_)-(_REF_) is bounded. 
Assume by contradiction that there exist a sequence of number _MATH_ and corresponding solutions _MATH_ of (_REF_)-(_REF_) such that _MATHDISP_. 
Set _MATH_. 
Obviously _MATH_ and _MATH_ satisfies _MATHDISP_. 
By (_REF_), (_REF_) and the fact that _MATH_ is continuous, there exist _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
In view of _MATH_, together with the choose of _MATH_, it follows that there exists _MATH_ such that, for all _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
It is easily seen that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on _MATH_. 
Then, using the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, there exist uniformly convergent subsequence on _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively, which are still denoted as _MATH_ and _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_. 
Clearly, _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is a solution of (_REF_)-(_REF_), for each _MATH_, we get _MATHDISP_, which implies that there exists _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
Owing to that the sequence _MATH_ and _MATH_ are uniformly bounded, there exist _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that, passing to subsequences if possible, _MATHDISP_. 
Multiplying both sides of (_REF_) by _MATH_ and integrating from _MATH_ to _MATH_, we get _MATHDISP_. 
Taking a superior limit as _MATH_, by (_REF_) and (_REF_)-(_REF_), we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
By the assumption (ii) and the choose of _MATH_, if _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_, the above inequalities can be rewritten as the following equivalent forms _MATHDISP_. 
It is easy to see that _MATH_. 
In fact, if not, in view of (_REF_)-(_REF_) we get _MATH_, which is contrary to that _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be matrix representations of _MATH_ and _MATH_, i.e., the Hessian of the quadratic form associated with the surface (see, for instance, _CITE_). 
The pencil of _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the set of their linear combinations, that is, _MATH_. 
The characteristic polynomial of the pencil is the determinant, _MATH_, which is a degree four polynomial in _MATH_. 
The intersection of any two quadrics is a non-singular quartic, in _MATH_, if and only if the characteristic equation of the corresponding pencil does not have any multiple roots (in _MATH_) _CITE_ (see also _CITE_). 
A non-singular quartic of _MATH_ is, in _MATH_, either empty or a non-singular quartic. 
Thus, since the trisector of our three lines cannot be the empty set in _MATH_, the trisector is a smooth quartic in _MATH_ if and only if the characteristic equation of the pencil does not have any multiple roots (in _MATH_).
In Figure 4, the cross-correlation functions for various combinations of the solar wind parameters are presented. 
The relative time lags are consistent with the time lags found in Figure 3. 
In addition, the _MATH_-_MATH_ function reveals a density depletion at around the time of the velocity peak (negative correlation coefficient dip in the cross-correlation function around _MATH_). 
Figures 3 and 4 show that the peaks in daily values of the solar wind parameters appear in the succession _MATH_, and are mutually lagged by about one day.
Since the above definitions cover all the possibilities, the map _MATH_ is an involution on the set _MATH_. 
It is also clear that the sign of the permutation encoded by a word changes when applying _MATH_ to it, since the parity of the number of _MATH_s in _MATH_ changes (note that the letters _MATH_ and _MATH_ do not contribute to the sign). 
It follows that _MATHDISP_ when _MATH_ has some part of even size, which agrees with the right hand side of equation _REF_ in this case.
On the other hand, each triangle _MATH_ is equipped with a unique affine mapping from _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
The linear portion of the affine mapping is denoted as a _MATH_ Jacobian matrix which is constant per triangle. 
We denote this matrix as _MATH_ to express its dependence on _MATH_. 
In particular, the elements of _MATH_ are linearly dependent on vertices of triangle _MATH_. 
We define the scaling error as: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the area of triangle _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the Frobenius norm.
Let _MATH_ be the slab enclosed between _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We now partition _MATH_ (and thus _MATH_) into congruent subslabs _MATH_ by adding _MATH_ planes parallel to _MATH_ inside _MATH_ at equal distances. 
Our next goal is to show that the strips _MATH_, for which _MATH_ is a good direction, behave as functions (with respect to that direction) within _MATH_. 
The following lemma is a simple variant of _CITE_:
Let the assumptions of Theorem _REF_ hold true. 
Assume that some algorithm _MATH_ satisfies the condition ( A) of Theorem _REF_ and takes the following form _MATH_, where for any _MATH_, the distribution of a random variable _MATH_ is absolutely continuous and positive on _MATH_. 
Then the algorithm _MATH_ converges, since the conditions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are satisfied by the reasons analogous to the above. 
For an interesting example of such algorithm _MATH_, see the GEM algorithm established in _CITE_, _CITE_.
Let us proceed to the details of the universal Turing machine. 
Throughout this chapter we assume that the Turing machines is deterministic unless otherwise stated. 
Initially, the universal Turing machine has on its tape the description of a Turing machine _MATH_, denoted by _MATH_, and an input to _MATH_, denoted by _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the string that somehow encodes a Turing machine _MATH_ that we want to simulate. 
More specifically, as illustrated in Figure _REF_, the contents of the tape of the universal Turing machine is stored in three regions, each containing the following information: the current state and the symbol under the head of _MATH_; the description of _MATH_; the tape contents of _MATH_. 
As illustrated in Figure _REF_, in the machine description region the sequence of 5-tuples separated by _MATH_s is placed, where each 5-tuple is expressed as the binary sequence representing _MATH_ such that _MATH_, where _MATH_ denotes the _MATH_'s transition function. 
To the right to the machine description region there exists the _MATH_'s tape region, where the current content of _MATH_'s tape is placed except for the square on which the head is located. 
On that square the marker _MATH_ is placed instead of the symbol under the head. 
Finally, to the left to the machine description region, there exists the machine condition region, where _MATH_'s current state _MATH_ and the current symbol _MATH_ under the head of _MATH_, namely the symbol that is supposed to be placed on the square of _MATH_. 
So the head position and the symbol under the head are stored separately. 
It will be explained shortly that the current symbol square in the machine condition region contains the symbol that _MATH_ has just read or is just about to write depending on the phase of the simulation.
In order to facilitate the study, before discussing the global stability of the coexistence equilibrium _MATH_, we rewrite the model as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
Obviously, for _MATH_, functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ have following properties
It can be noticed from Table _REF_ that since {0,2,3}repeats two times, number of distinct subsequences are given as below.
The idea of _MATH_-best search can easily be combined with the representation of traceback information in the form of word-link records as described in the previous section. 
Back-pointers to alternative word-level predecessors of hypotheses can be represented quite compactly if the data structure is extended appropriately. 
Instead of storing references to a certain number of alternative predecessors in the successor node, every note stores only the link to the optimal precessor and to the next-best alternative hypothesis ending at the same time _MATH_ _CITE_. 
Figure _REF_ shows an example of such a set of doubly-linked hypothesis data structures that can serve as the basis for generating _MATH_-best results by an A_MATH_-based backward search.
The model computations with the self absorption and gyroresonance one in the case of nonuniform magnetic field show the effects of the electron parameters and the source parameters on the peak frequency of gyrosynchrotron spectrum to be rather essential. 
We discovered both the peak frequency and the maximum flux obviously increase with increasing low energy cutoff, number density, input depth of energetic electrons, magnetic field strength and the viewing angle. 
However, the peak frequency is independent of the energy spectral index, high energy cutoff of energetic electrons and the height of upper boundary of radio source of the energetic electrons. 
Based on the theoretical result we can predict a relatively constant or a varying peak frequency during the evolution of a burst.
Later in this book we'll discuss a programming model from the database community, in which applications are structured as "transactions" that operate on databases or other forms of persistent data storage. 
Databases are extremely important in commercial computing settings, and transactions are often closely integrated with RPC environments. 
For example, the J2EE system was developed as a very general purposed Java runtime environment, but has gradually become more and more popular for database applications encapsulated as "Java Beans." 
In support of this style of programming, J2EE provides an elaborate transactional package. 
Similarly, Microsoft's .NET system has a very comprehensive database subsystem called ADO.
NET. 
Applications using this package gain automatic access to a transactional mechanism integrated with the basic .NET remote procedure call.
We prove that finding a spanning tree of minimum axis-parallel stabbing number is an _MATH_-hard problem; we extend this result to general stabbing number, and sketch _MATH_-hardness proofs for minimum axis-parallel or general crossing number.
If we assume that energetically large flares are separated by longer waiting times on the average, we can conclude that the relatively long duration of energetic flares appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the long waiting times defined by the point-like events. 
Thus, the EtS definition tends to mimic the PtP in the righthand half of the _MATH_ domain, where the waiting times are longer.
Figure _REF_ shows a typical spectrum of a pixel which belongs to an area covered by a transverse oscillation of a coronal loop. 
One of the possible criteria of periodicity detection is to accept the maximum value of the spectral function as the signal if the value is _MATH_ times greater than the mean value of the spectral function. 
In practice, for TRACE signals, the value of _MATH_ may be about 3 or 4.
In fig. _REF_a we see a time series of the system for some given parameters and its stroboscopic map with respect to the period of the external excitation. 
The response regimes presented in the map reveal seemingly quasi-periodic nature with relatively neat orbits. 
In the map obtained for the same system under slightly stronger excitation at fig. _REF_b, the random scatter implies a very complex quasi-periodic response or even a chaotic response as investigated in Sect. _REF_. 
Note that although the time series seem similar at first glance, additional focus on the beat reveals a small difference between the two responses.
Finally, if the general system (_REF_) has zeros, the numerator term _MATH_ is canceled by a neighboring denominator term (_MATH_), where both _MATH_ and _MATH_ are positive and real, using the following approximations _MATHDISP_
If _MATH_, the function _MATHDISP_ extends as an holomorphic function to _MATH_ for some _MATH_.
Figure _REF_ (top) shows the ratio values for different activity levels of incoming social features. 
Compared to participatory features, the ratios of special users appearing among the lower activity levels in terms of views are lower, which emphasizes the differences between special users and Standard users. 
We find _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, and _MATH_, compared to the _MATH_. 
Clearly, Gurus, Directors, and Reporters, are the ones who get more attention from the community in terms of accumulated views, with _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ respectively. 
Compared to them, the ratio for the most active Comedians and Musicians is roughly cut in half, with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We performed KS tests for pair-wise combinations of these distributions. 
Two-sided KS tests reported no significant differences betwen Comedians and Musicians across all the levels of activity. 
In addition, one-sided KS tests indicate that the differences between the Comedians and Musicians and the rest of the special users are consistent, and that they are significantly receiving less views.
The changing requirements in transportation and logistics have recently induced the appearance of new vehicle routing problems that include complex constraints as precedence or loading constraints. 
One of these problems that have appeared during the last few years is the Double Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks (DTSPMS), a vehicle routing problem in which some pickups and deliveries must be performed in two independent networks, verifying some precedence and loading constraints imposed on the vehicle. 
In this paper four new neighborhood structures for the DTSPMS based on reinsertion and permutation of orders to modify both the routes and the loading planning of the solutions are introduced and described in detail. 
They can be used in combination with any metaheuristic using local search as a subprocedure, guiding the search to unexplored zones of the solution space. 
Some computational results obtained using all proposed neighborhood structures are presented, providing good quality solutions for real sized instances.
The spectrum index of the power-law discussed above is found to vary with the guide field _MATH_ as well. 
For electrons, it varies with _MATH_ as shown in Figure 11. 
In the case of weak background field (_MATH_ G, Figure 11a), the index _MATH_ decreases rapidly with _MATH_ when _MATH_ ranges from 0 to 0.6, and then increases slowly as _MATH_. 
In the case of strong background field (_MATH_ G, Figure 11b), less electrons are accelerated to high energy, the spectrum at high-energy tail tends to become softer than that in the case of weak _MATH_, and _MATH_ decreases sharply as _MATH_ is between 0 and 0.3, then remains roughly unchanged in range of larger _MATH_.
The subexpression _MATH_ enforces that there is at most one such assertion made for any set of blocks _MATH_ (by a satisfying truth assignment). 
_MATH_ insures that the right number of blocks are pointed to in the solution of the positive-satisfaction problem. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ enforce that the solution indicated for the positive satisfaction problem created by _MATH_ must be a solution computed in _MATH_. 
_MATH_ forces the indicated solution to be "implemented" in the variables of _MATH_.
In recent years, there is increasing interest in Fractional Calculus which allows describe a real object more accurately and more adequate than the integer methods _CITE_, because the fractional-order operator's characteristics of having an unlimited memory_CITE_. 
It has been found that many physical systems can be properly described by using the fractional-order system theory _CITE_. 
During the past several years, a large number of various fractional-order systems have been proposed, such as the fractional-order Chua's system, the fractional-order Rossler equation, the fractional-order Chen system, the fractional-order Liu system _CITE_.
Proof. 
On the one hand, integrating the equation _MATHDISP_ over _MATH_ for three times, we have _MATHDISP_. 
And then _MATHDISP_. 
Combining them with boundary condition _MATH_, we conclude that _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, _MATHDISP_. 
On the other hand, since _MATHDISP_. 
therefore, _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, we get _MATH_
According to conventional averaging procedures, the constant _MATH_ is to provide a zero mean of the right-hand side of equation (_REF_) and therefore - periodicity of its solution. 
In contrast, the algorithm below generates the operator of averaging automatically by satisfying the conditions of smoothness that is boundary conditions of the corresponding boundary value problem.
Figure _REF_ reports the UML-_MATH_ modeling of the Place Order scenario. 
The scenario provides two interesting behavioral patterns: the alternative and parallel executions. 
The former is related to the emptiness of the cart. 
If the cart is empty the scenario terminates showing an error page to the customer, otherwise it proceeds with the placement of the order. 
The probability of executing one of the two alternative behaviors is annotated by the PAprob tagged value. 
The error scenario can happen with $Perror probability, whereas the order placement completes with 1-$Perror probability. 
The latter corresponds to the last tasks before the order page is displayed. 
In fact, the "update cart" and the "assembly data" activities are executing in parallel to minimize the response time. 
Finally, note that in the activity diagram the Create new order is a macro-activity containing three basic actions. 
In the transformation towards the simulation model the basic actions are not considered whereas the composite one will contribute to generate a SimpleAction process since it is the only one stereotyped by the PAstep.
Multivariate pattern recognition (MVPR) methods for fMRI analysis have made major contributions in studying the representation of information in the brain, i.e., how distributed neuronal responses encode the sensorial or cognitive state of the subject _CITE_. 
The main advantage of the multivariate approach is its sensitivity to the distributed nature of cognitive processes by integrating activation information from groups of voxels that individually are weakly activated, but whose joint activations are highly structured with respect to the task. 
MVPR methods such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), neural-networks, support vector machines (SVMs) and other types of pattern classifiers _CITE_ treat the data as an abstract representation of neural activity without modeling the underlying neurophysiology. 
Although this approach can be an advantage when facing complete uncertainty about the neurophysiology, judiciously incorporating well-proven assumptions into a model, as in the method used here, can provide the ability to make a wider range of inferences and, moreover, can permit neurophysiologic interpretation of the results _CITE_. 
Furthermore, most MVPR methods make the assumption that all fMRI time-points with the same label (i.e., behavioral state) are equivalent, thereby neglecting temporal variations in mental processes _CITE_. 
The current method, on the other hand, provides a multivariate dynamical system model to understand the spatio-temporal representation of brain function.
The work presented as case study in CT1 has significantly been expanded, and the bifurcation and spectral tilt have been added as further evidence that at least some EEs are not due to bi-directional reconnection flows. 
The detailed empirical model presented here, of the explosive events being rotating cylindrically-shaped jets, is fully consistent with the observations. 
Our new interpretation can also account for unexplained features found in older literature.
Thus, we may assume that _MATH_ is neither horizontal nor vertical. 
Since _MATH_ intersects the four horizontal lines at distinct points, it follows that either _MATH_ goes through one of these points or it is parallel to _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_ intersect then they can do so only at one of the four vertices of _MATH_, whose coordinates are _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The first three coincide with points where a vertical line of the arrangement intersects a horizontal line also in the arrangement. 
This allows us to translate the corresponding point to the origin, so that _MATH_ for some nonzero real number _MATH_. 
Using makeDarboux, we find three arrangements of type 6. 
The point _MATH_ has to be handled separately because it is not contained in any vertical line of the arrangement. 
However, using makeDarboux we find that no 9-line Darboux arrangement contains a line of the form _MATH_. 
Assuming now that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are parallel, we have that _MATH_, for some nonzero real number _MATH_. 
By Proposition _REF_ this line must go through two vertices in _MATH_. 
Applying makeDarboux, we find six arrangements, all of which turn out to be of type 7.
Proof: 
If _MATH_ then, by Proposition 15.3, _MATHDISP_ and so _MATH_, which shows that _MATH_. 
Thus _MATH_ is monic. 
We need to frame Propositions _REF_ and _REF_ in the context of spawning period dynamics under the SPL. 
In the period _MATH_, we consider "immigrants" representing _MATH_ mutations. 
We have the following facts that relate to the assumptions of Proposition _REF_.
Step _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
Assume that _MATHDISP_ are obtained. 
Set _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Find the _MATH_-memory common sub-Nash equilibriums over _MATH_ (just compare with strategies in _MATH_) with tolerance _MATH_.
If _MATH_ is a domain, we endow the space _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ (cf. Subsection _REF_) with the norm _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is an open nonempty set with compact closure _MATH_. 
From (_REF_) it follows that varying _MATH_ leads to an equivalent norm.
In fact, a stronger statement was proved in the last paper. 
To understand this, we need another definition. 
So far our definition only concerned coverings of the whole plane, but we could investigate coverings of any fixed planar point set. 
We say that a planar set is totally-cover-decomposable if there is a _MATH_ such that any _MATH_-fold covering of any planar point set by its translates is decomposable. 
In earlier papers this property was not defined, however, the proofs all work for this stronger version. 
This is the first paper that makes distinction of these definitions. 
To avoid confusion, we will call the cover-decomposable sets in this paper plane-cover-decomposable. 
By definition, if a set is totally-cover-decomposable, then it is also plane-cover-decomposable. 
On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that there are sets, or even polygons, which are plane-cover-decomposable, but not totally-cover-decomposable. 
From the negative direction very little is known.
Now we compute the more challenging diagram in Fig 4. 
Following the standard Feynman rules of QED, we can write down the explicit expression _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ where we have used Feynman parameters to combine some of the denominators. 
Next, in order to integrate over momentum _MATH_, we apply the UVDP parametrization to combine the factors involving _MATH_ in the denominator to get _MATHDISP_, where we define _MATHDISP_. 
Then we make the following translation _MATHDISP_. 
By expanding the trace of the product of gamma matrices and contracting the Lorentz indices, we write the numerator as, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Note that in above expression, we have used _MATH_s to simplify our notation which represent the four factors in the Eq.(_REF_) after the translation of Eq.(_REF_). 
Due to their complexity, we do not write them out explicitly.
Combining our estimates for _MATH_ and _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
Now use _MATH_ to get _MATHDISP_. 
If the quantity inside the square brackets above is less than 1 it follows that _MATH_ tends to 0 as _MATH_ tends to infinity. 
In other words if _MATHDISP_ then _MATH_ tends to 0 an _MATH_ tends to infinity. 
Since _MATHDISP_ the result follow if we take _MATHDISP_. 
The above proof can be modified to allow a matching scheme that averages _MATH_ independent uniform random matches per period. 
The value of _MATH_ in the theorem will then depend upon _MATH_ in addition to the game coefficients. 
It would be quite useful however to find general conditions on the aggregate matching distribution, _MATH_, that imply the limiting distribution of strategies places unit mass on the Pareto efficient strategy. 
Suppose _MATH_ is the basin process of an evolutionary process with uniform random matching once per period. 
Suppose the _MATH_ strategy game and _MATH_ satisfy the conditions of Theorem _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ denote the stationary distribution of _MATH_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
The stationary distribtion of _MATH_ is the limiting distribution of _MATH_ so _MATHDISP_ where the parameters _MATH_ and _MATH_ are not written on the right side of the above equation but are in fact parameters of the _MATH_ process. 
Now _MATH_ exactly when _MATH_. 
Therefore _MATHDISP_. 
Apply the result of Theorem _REF_ to complete the proof. 
As an immediate corollary of Theorem _REF_ and the results of Section 5 of _CITE_, Games of Common Interest, and in particular footnote 25, we see that the order in which one takes the limit as population size tends to infinity or mutation parameter tends to zero is inconsequential. 
Suppose a _MATH_ strategy evolutionary process with uniform random matching once per period satisfies the conditions of Theorem _REF_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
For a two strategy evolutionary process with uniform random matching and game coefficients that satisfy the conditions (_REF_), it is natural to ask if the limiting distribution for the basin process places all mass on the risk dominant equilibrium if the mutation parameter is greater than the _MATH_ of Theorem _REF_. 
With some additional work it is possible to show that if _MATH_ is greater than the weight on the Pareto dominant strategy in the mixed Nash equilibrium, _MATHDISP_, then the limiting distribution as _MATH_ tends to infinity does place all weight on the risk dominant strategy. 
In this case the transition probability _MATH_ is bounded below by a positive constant and _MATH_ tends to 0 as _MATH_ tends to infinity. 
Therefore one expects that values of _MATH_ smaller than _MATH_ above will still result in a limiting distribution placing all weight on the risk dominant strategy. 
By using the explicit expression for the distribution of _MATH_ (equation (_REF_), Bayes' rule, and the distribution of the binomial, it can be shown that the stationary distribution, _MATH_, is a rational function of powers of _MATH_. 
Therefore it seems likely that there will be a critical value of _MATH_ such that for _MATH_ below this critical value, the limiting distribution will place all mass on the Pareto efficient equilibrium and for _MATH_ above this critical value the limiting distribution will place all mass on the risk dominant equilibrium. 
Finally, we provide a simple example to show that matching can preserve individual randomness, and yet the limiting distribution as population size tends to infinity can put mass one on the risk dominant strategy. 
More examples of this type can be found in _CITE_. 
Consider a population of _MATH_ players with _MATH_ selecting strategy _MATH_ and _MATH_ selecting strategy _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_. 
Randomly match the players by first constructing four subsets of players, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Create _MATH_ (_MATH_) by randomly selecting _MATH_ of the _MATH_ (respectively _MATH_) players. 
There are _MATHDISP_ ways to make this selection and we assume each equally likely. 
Note that the probability that an _MATH_ player ends up in _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, the probability that an _MATH_ player ends up in _MATH_ is approximately _MATH_. 
Now the remaining _MATH_(_MATH_) players are placed in _MATH_ (respectively _MATH_). 
Finally, randomly match (uniform distribution on all possible matches) the _MATH_ players in _MATH_ with the _MATH_ players in _MATH_. 
Randomly match (uniform distribution) all players in _MATH_ with other players in _MATH_, and all players in _MATH_ with other players in _MATH_. 
If the number of players in _MATH_ is odd the same will be true for _MATH_. 
In this case match the odd _MATH_ player with the odd _MATH_ player (randomly selected). 
Hence the probability that an _MATH_ player is matched with an _MATH_ player is approximately _MATH_, and the probability that an _MATH_ player is matched with an _MATH_ player is approximately _MATH_.
The synchronized product of transition systems is too abstract to be of practical use for software engineers. 
In order to express broadcast communications (item 1 in Sect. _REF_), we allow Interface Automata to be composed in terms of extended synchronization vectors, defined in Sect. _REF_.
In the last few years several new approaches have been used for the calculation of the _MATH_-decay NMEs: the angular momentum Projected Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method (PHFB) _CITE_, the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) _CITE_, and the Energy Density Functional method (EDF) _CITE_. 
In the PHFB approach, the nucleon pairs different from _MATH_ in the intrinsic coordinate system are strongly suppressed. 
In the framework of the ISM and the QRPA approaches it was shown, however, that other neutron pairs make significant contributions _CITE_. 
Let us notice also that in the IBM approach only transitions of _MATH_ and _MATH_ neutron pairs into proton pairs are taken into account. 
The EDF approach is an improvement with respect to the PHFB approach. 
Beyond-mean-field effects are included within the generating coordinate method with particle number and angular momentum projection for both initial and final ground states. 
But, the quality of the IBM and the EDF many-body wave functions have not been tested yet by the calculation of the _MATH_-decay half-lives.
Section _REF_ contains a proof of Theorem _REF_, which relies upon a lower bound for _MATH_ for products of cyclotomic polynomials. 
We obtain some explicit formulas for _MATH_ for cyclotomic polynomials and their products in Section _REF_, thereby proving Theorem _REF_. 
Section _REF_ contains some partial results towards _MATH_ for cyclotomic polynomials. 
In particular we prove Theorem _REF_ in this section. 
Section _REF_ presents results about limiting points for _MATH_. 
We first consider an _MATH_-version for Theorem _REF_ in _REF_. 
A fundamental ingredient in the proof of Theorem _REF_ is a theorem of Boyd and Lawton which shows that the Mahler measure of a multivariable polynomial arises as a limit of Mahler measures of polynomials of one variable. 
In _REF_ we discuss a generalization of Boyd-Lawton theorem and prove the limit of Theorem _REF_. 
In Section 5.3 we prove that these sequences are non identically zero. 
Finally, Section _REF_ includes a discussion about future questions and a table with values of _MATH_ for the reciprocal non-cyclotomic polynomials _MATH_ of degree less than or equal to 14 and _MATH_. 
We observe that all the polynomials in the table have lower values of _MATH_ than Lehmer's degree 10 polynomial.
A Signorini-type initial-boundary value problem. 
We consider the following initial-boundary value problem for a real-valued function _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, involving the given right-hand side _MATH_, the (time-independent) function _MATH_ defining the boundary condition, as well as the given initial condition _MATH_.
The Content and User Acquisition Tier registers content and users into the system. 
The Subscription Manager handles two classes of users: searchers and performers. 
Searchers use CUbRIK applications for finding information and provide feedback on query result quality. 
Performers execute tasks (via gaming or Query &amp;Answer) to provide and validate semantic annotations, and resolve conflicts produced by machine tasks.
Suppose that the number and dimension of the particles are _MATH_ and _MATH_, the average velocity of the particle swarm is defined as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the _MATH_th dimensional velocity of the _MATH_th particle.
Finally, fix _MATH_ and consider independent claim numbers _MATH_ and _MATH_ satisfying _REF_. 
Then _MATH_ follows a Poisson mixture distribution given by _REF_, where_MATH_ is the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution from Example _REF_. 
Thus we can calculate the distribution of _MATH_ by the numerically stable Algorithm _REF_. 
It follows from _REF_ and _REF_ that, for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_ by comparison with _REF_, which belongs to the _MATH_ class, and Panjer's recursion in Theorem _REF_ for computing the distribution of _MATH_ is numerically stable. 
Finally one convolution delivers the distribution of _MATH_.
The methods of section 3 have been shown to characterize changes in the distribution of active region magnetic fields, during region formation and flaring. 
The multifractal spectrum allows us to monitor the complexity and significance across different scales. 
The emergence of small flux measurers causes a change in the singularity spectrum, as the significance of larger flux measures is reduced. 
A decrease in the fractal dimension is also seen in the _MATH_ region of the _MATH_ spectrum. 
As such, sudden changes in the multifractal parameters are an excellent mathematical tool for detecting characteristic changes in active regions.
(2) If _MATH_, then _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_. 
Therefore, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Once again _MATH_. 
Furthermore, _MATH_. 
Finally, _MATHDISP_
Relaxing the uncorrelated input process in _CITE_ with a single correlated arrival process (and service interruptions), Ishizaki _CITE_ studies both finite and infinite buffer queues and obtains an exact relation between the loss probability in the finite buffer queue and the queue length distribution in the corresponding infinite-buffer queue.
We impose periodic boundary conditions along the _MATH_-direction of the _MATH__MATH__MATH_ lattice. 
The initial condition is a flat linear front (straight vertical line), i.e., the invader completely occupies a few vertical columns at the left edge of the lattice, and all remaining sites are occupied by the resident. 
Invasive advance, therefore, proceeds in the _MATH_-direction. 
As a simulation begins, mortality quickly reduces the density on each side of the front to the respective "quasi-equilibrium" value, where a species' propagation balances its mortality. 
As a simulation continues, we track the location of the invading front by defining the edge as the location of the right-most individual of the invading species, _MATH_, for each row _MATH_ (Fig. _REF_). 
We shall also refer to this quantity as the local "height" [borrowing terminology from the non-equilibrium surface and interface-growth literature _CITE_]. 
We record the average position _MATH_ for each time step. 
We estimate velocity once _MATH_ approaches linear increase with time. 
We ran each simulation until the front reached the end of the system. 
Longitudinal system size _MATH_ has no particular impact on system behavior. 
But the transverse system size _MATH_ plays a fundamental role in controlling the large-scale properties of the emerging fronts and the interface region. 
Hence the size of the habitat (specifically, the length of the front) will exert an important influence on the dynamics of ecological invasion.
Consider a sphere of two non-interacting particles falling freely towards the center of the Earth. 
Each particle moves on a straight line, but nearer the Earth fall faster because the gravitational attraction is stronger. 
This means that the sphere does not remain a sphere but is distorted into an ellipsoid with the same volume. 
The same effect occurs in a body falling towards a spherical object in general relativity, but if the object is a black hole the effect becomes infinite as the singularity is reached. 
Jacobi vector fields provide the connection between the behavior of nearby particles and curvature, via the equation of geodesic deviation (Jacobi equation) _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ are the components of the tangent vector to geodesic and _MATH_ are the components of the connecting vector between two neighboring geodesics.
In Exercises _REF_ to _REF_, prove the given result about the Fibonacci numbers, for all positive integers _MATH_.
In the present work we are not concerned with the convergence of the formal series whose coefficients are defined by the homological Equation (_REF_). 
Rather, we are interested in determining when a finite number of terms of _MATH_ provides a reliable numerical approximation to a local stable/unstable manifold. 
Nevertheless the formal series do converge, as shown in _CITE_. 
In that reference, and under the assumptions above, the parameterization power series are shown to converge to entire functions.
Since thermal conduction is known to have a strong effect on slow modes, we will concentrate our analysis on the properties of slow modes. 
It has been shown by a number of authors, e.g. _CITE_ and _CITE_, that slow modes can be isolated by assuming _MATH_. 
Therefore the linear, dissipative, MHD equations for the slow modes in the presence of thermal conduction reduce to a 1D system given by _MATHDISP_, Here _MATH_. 
Although there are now no terms relating to the magnetic field, the slow waves are still guided by the magnetic field. 
Dimensionless variables can now be introduced to simplify the equations, where the following dimensionless quantities are suggested: _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_ is the initial sound speed, _MATH_ is the wavelength of the oscillations, and _MATH_ is the sound travel time of the oscillations. 
The dimensionless background temperature is given by (after removing tilde) _MATHDISP_, so _MATHDISP_. 
Using coronal values, (see, e.g., _CITE_), we find _MATH_ is a small quantity, where the standard coronal values of all variables _MATHDISP_, give a value of _MATH_ for _MATH_ MK and _MATH_ for _MATH_ MK.
Alice first selects a Bilinear Group _MATH_ of prime order _MATH_ with _MATH_ generator. 
Two random numbers _MATH_ and _MATH_ of order _MATH_ are generated. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ are then use to generate secret respective keys _MATH_ and _MATH_, consequently public key are produced as _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Once public key are defined Alice will select a random number _MATH_, along with a Bilinear Map of _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
Finally, proxy-key is generated as _MATH_ and is handed over to the semi-trusted server responsible for cipher text transformation.
This section describes the expected flavor structure and mass spectrum in the two most popular mediation schemes. 
The first is gravity mediation, where the fact that SUSY is broken in the hidden sector is communicated to the MSSM particles by their gravitational interactions, which are always present _CITE_. 
These effects include "anomaly-mediated" contributions as a subset. 
The second scheme is gauge mediation, where there is an additional "messenger" sector containing (supersymmetrically) heavy particles charged under the SM gauge group and with direct couplings to the hidden sector SUSY-breaking field(s) _MATH_. 
Here the flavor structure is very non-generic, being flavor-blind at the messenger scale.
The following theorem is derived under the assumption that the initial set and the trajectory set have the same shape, namely _MATH_, for a given positive scalar _MATH_. 
System _REF_ is finite-time stable with respect to _MATH_, with _MATH_, if, letting _MATH_, there exist a scalar _MATH_ and a positive definite matrix _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Notice that statelessness and a relaxed approach to authentication are two separate issues, although in practice they often go hand-in-hand. 
What makes NFS stateless is a server design in which the server does n't worry about copies of vnodes or file blocks on client systems. 
The UNIX client protocol is responsible for noticing staleness (in practice, applications are expected to use locking if they want to avoid potential problems). 
Even when NFS runs with authentication enabled, it remains a stateless architecture. 
Microsoft's file system, and the two CMU-developed file systems, employ not just stronger authentication mechanisms, but also forms of statefulness. 
One "sees" the statelessness of the NFS file system in many situations: when a create operation returns EEXISTS and yet the file did n't exist before the request was issued, when a file read returns a stale cached file block rather than the most recently updated version, or when a change visible on a client system is nonetheless not seen by the server, perhaps for a long time.
Knowing the derivatives of opacity, it is now possible to calculate the darkening and visibility functions for the most dominant solar oscillation mode with _MATH_.
However, there are few results in the open literature on filtering design of piecewise linear systems, to the best of our knowledge, although there exist many results of filtering design for other kinds of systems, e.g., _CITE_. 
The authors in _CITE_ presented a moving-horizon estimation algorithm for discrete-time piecewise linear systems. 
A number of sufficient conditions had been developed to guarantee asymptotic convergence of the moving horizon estimation algorithm, and some practical implementation issues had also been addressed. 
In _CITE_, the author presented the _MATH_ filtering and the generalized _MATH_ filtering for the piecewise discrete-time linear systems. 
It is noted that the filter of observer type structure in _CITE_ has significantly reduced the complexity of the filter design for the piecewise linear systems. 
Moreover, in _CITE_ the output space partitions were also assumed so that filter implementation was synchronized with plant output trajectory transitions. 
In _CITE_ the authors investigated the problem of robust _MATH_ filter design for uncertain discrete piecewise time-delay systems based on a piecewise Lyapunov functional, where the state of the plant and the filter state are assumed to operate in the same region at the same time. 
However, we also noted that many piecewise linear systems are more likely partitioned based on plant state, and in such a case, there is no guarantee that the plant and the filter state always operate in the same region at the same time. 
In other words, it is most likely that the state of the plant and the filter state might stay in different regions from time to time. 
Therefore it is very interesting to study the more general filter structure. 
In this paper, we are interested in the _MATH_ filtering problem with general filter structure for piecewise discrete linear systems. 
The key contribution is that the transition of the plant state and its filter state among the regions are not required to be synchronized.
Suppose that _MATH_ so that products may be differentiated only by price and leadtime. 
Prospective customers are of two types. 
A type 1 customer's valuation for a product with zero maximum leadtime is drawn from a uniform _MATH_ distribution, and it decreases linearly with the maximum leadtime, with slope _MATH_. 
A type 2 customer's valuation for a product with zero maximum leadtime is drawn from a uniform _MATH_ distribution, and it decreases linearly with the maximum leadtime, with slope _MATH_. 
Customers of each type arrive at rate 1. 
To maximize the profit rate, it is sufficient to offer only two products, with prices and leadtimes chosen such that customers of type 1 prefer product 1 and customers of type 2 prefer product 2: _MATHDISP_. 
Then a type _MATH_ customer having valuation _MATH_ buys product _MATH_ if and only if _MATHDISP_ and the demand rate for product _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore the static planning problem reduces to _MATHDISP_ subject to the incentive compatibility constraint (_REF_) and _MATHDISP_. 
When _MATH_, the unique solution is _MATHDISP_, which implies that _MATHDISP_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_.
The coefficient of _MATH_ in _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
From the second equation in (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_ Using the relations between (_REF_) and (_REF_), we obtain _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ 
On the other hand, From (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_. 
Multiplying this equation by _MATH_, we obtain _MATHDISP_ and the last equation is equal to (_REF_). 
Thus, we showed that the coefficients of _MATH_ and _MATH_ on both sides of the first equation in (_REF_) are equal. 
The remaining _MATH_ can be verified similarly. 
All alternative values of _MATH_ are given at the end of the paper. 
These verifications prove the theorem.
When the group sizes _MATH_ are not necessarily equal, similar results on the mean vector, the covariance matrix, and the estimators for _MATH_ can be obtained by mimicking the derivations of the results in Sections 2 and 3. 
The mean vector _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_, and the covariance matrix is given by _MATHDISP_. 
We can also obtain the MLE, _MATH_, and the unbiased estimator _MATH_ for _MATH_ shown as below
Lemma 2.4 [12]. 
Let _MATH_ be a real Banach space. 
Suppose that _MATHDISP_ is completely continuous and _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is the isolated solution of the equation _MATHDISP_ 
Furthermore, assume that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a isolated neighborhood of trivial solutions. 
Let _MATHDISP_. 
Then there exists a continuum (i.e., a closed connected set) _MATH_ of _MATH_ containing _MATH_, and either
Since optical fibres are intrinsically connected to the EOM and since their optical path length changes due to bending and temperature fluctuations, we measured the differential phase dependence of the fibre's temperature. 
While changing the temperature of the fibre connected to the output of the EOM (as done with a 38 cm section) the sidebands of the modulated laser light were shifted in relation to the carrier. 
The results are shown in Fig. _REF_ (red trace). 
Scaled to a fibre length of 1 m, the temperature induced phase shift was measured to be _MATH_. 
Therefore, including the 1.5 m fibre connected to the output the EOM's output, the EOM's phase dependence on its temperature was measured to be _MATH_. 
The temperature stability at the LISA optical bench is expected to be better than of _MATH_ at room temperature. 
Thus the given stability of the EOM fulfills the phase stability requirements with a large margin.
The authors of this paper believe, that the new haptic interface will influence the clinical workflow with 3D volume data in a similar way as the invention of the classic computer mouse influenced 2D tasks like paint programs or word processing. 
Therefore it is planned to use YaDiV as a platform to develop and test new approaches in close contact with our medical partners. 
The necessary modules (stereographic and fast visualization, segmentation algorithms, support for haptic interfaces) are already implemented.
Performance comparisons with larger networks are shown in Fig. _REF_. 
Figures _REF_ (a) and (b) exhibit comparisons in deterministic routing and fully-adaptive routing, respectively. 
It is observed that TM performs best in deterministic routing in the aspect of average delay and throughput, which benefits from the lower average hops and diameter compared to mesh, and more balancing utilization of virtual channels compared to torus. 
In fully-adaptive routing, performance of TM is just between mesh and torus. 
When using 3 virtual channels, the unbalancing use of virtual channels is eased, and the lower average hops and diameter contributes the performance enhancement in torus. 
For a pir of 0.05 in fully adaptive routing, the average delay of mesh, TM and torus are 28.7, 20.7 and 19.0, respectively. 
Compared to mesh, TM and torus reduce the average delay by 27.9% and 33.8%.
The following estimates hold true: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_. 
_MATH_. 
Firstly we consider _MATH_. 
By Lemmas 2, 6 and (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
We performed also some parametric studies to explore the accuracy of the forward-fitting code as a function of some control parameters that are different from the standard settings given in Table 1. 
We list the results in Table 3. 
If we increase the spatial resolution of the field line extrapolation to _MATH_, the accuracy of the field lines does not change, neither in terms of the the mean misalignment angle nor in the divergence-freeness figure of merit (Table 3, second line). 
Increasing the number of magnetic components in the decomposition of magnetograms does not improve the accuracy for the potential-field cases ( e.g., by a factor of two compared with the simulated numbers of _MATH_), but degrades the divergence-freeness and force-freeness and increases the computation time by a factor of _MATH_ (Table 3, third line). 
Starting the field line extrapolation at the footpoints (_MATH_), rather than from the loop midpoints (_MATH_), leads to no significant improvement (Table 3, fourth line). 
Changing the weighting of coronal loop constraints (_MATH_) to using only photospheric vector magnetograph data (_MATH_) improves the misalignment to _MATH_, which represents an improvement in the accuracy by about a factor of two, but requires about five times more computation time. 
Thus, the accuracy in fitting potential field cases is fairly robust and does not depend the detailed setting of control parameters, except for the weigthing of photospheric versus coronal constraints.

In the following, the chains of the considered use cases are presented. 
A chain is defined as a graph-based whose nodes are service centers and arrows represent interactions among the centers.
Let _MATH_ an ordered Banach space. 
An operator _MATH_ is said to be nondecreasing (nonincreasing), provided that _MATH_ (_MATH_) for all _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
If the inequality is strict, then _MATH_ is said to be strictly nondecreasing (nonincreasing).
Emerging many-core platforms yield enormous raw processing power, in the form of massive SIMD parallelism. 
Chip designers are increasing processing capabilities by building multiple processing cores in a single chip. 
The number of cores that can fit into a chip is increasing at a fast pace and as a result Moore's Law has been given a new interpretation: it is the number of cores that doubles every _MATH_ months _CITE_. 
The NVIDIA GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is one of several available coprocessors that feature a large number of cores. 
Traditionally, GPUs have been especially designed to handle computations for computer graphics in real-time. 
Today, they are increasingly being exploited as general-purpose attached processors to speed-up computations in image processing, physical simulations, data mining, linear algebra, etc. 
GPUs is specialized for compute-intensive and massively parallel computations. 
For this type of computation, they are often vastly superior to architectures like multi-core CPUs, since "more transistors are devoted to data processing rather than data caching and flow control"_CITE_.
_MATH_. 
For each _MATH_ and _MATH_, the following assertions hold:
An interesting application of a system using mechanical camera sensors in conjunction with a separate set of cameras for object tracking is 'FoxTrax' _CITE_. 
This system is designed to render a graphical overlay on an ice hockey puck to improve its visibility. 
The puck has a set of infra-red LEDs embedded in it, which are picked up by an array of 8 infra-red cameras looking down from the roof. 
The 3D position of the puck is computed by triangulation from these camera images, and a graphical overlay rendered to match the view of a broadcast camera fitted with sensors for pan, tilt and zoom. 
In addition to rendering a 'blue glow' over the puck, the system can also add a 'comet tail' to show the motion of the puck during periods of rapid acceleration.
The study of independent spanning trees has applications in fault-tolerant protocols for distributed computing networks. 
For example, broadcasting in a network is sending a message from a given vertex to all the other vertices in the network. 
A fault-tolerant broadcasting protocol can be designed by means of independent spanning trees _CITE_. 
The vertex set and the edge set of a graph _MATH_ are denoted by _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
Two paths _MATH_ and _MATH_ connecting a vertex _MATH_ to a vertex _MATH_ are said to be internally disjoint if _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
A spanning tree of a graph _MATH_ is a subgraph of _MATH_ that contains all vertices in _MATH_ and forms a tree. 
Two rooted spanning trees _MATH_ and _MATH_ of a graph _MATH_ are said to be independent (referred to as ISTs for short) if they are rooted at the same vertex, say _MATH_, and for each vertex _MATH_, the two paths from _MATH_ to _MATH_, one path in each tree, are internally disjoint (or called vertex-disjoint). 
Also, we call a set of rooted spanning trees of _MATH_ to be independent if they are pairwise independent.
The fractional-order Modified hybrid optical system
In this chapter, the model of the coupled vessel, crane, cable and payload with nonuniform parameters has been presented. 
Positioning controls have been derived for the coupled system with uniform parameters using Barrier Lyapunov Functions. 
Through Lyapunov analysis, it was shown that the coupled crane, payload flexible system is stable under the control action, the physical limits from operations planning and safety specifications are not transgressed and positioning of crane and payload is achieved. 
A stabilizing boundary control is proposed for the coupled system with nonuniform parameters. 
Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis was carried out and uniform boundedness of the system was shown under the proposed control. 
Finally, the performance of the proposed controls have been illustrated through numerical simulations.
Provide a user interface that remaining components can be selected (by clicking) one by one, calculate for each selected component its centroid, main axis, and eccentricity, and visualize those values in some way for the selected component. 
For visualizing eccentricity you may draw, for example, an ellipse of corresponding eccentricity, or just show a bar at the selected component whose height corresponds to the value of eccentricity. 
For centroid and main axis, do similar as illustrated in Figure _REF_.
The matrix _MATH_ represents the mass matrix of the _MATH_ subsystem and in the term _MATH_ the nonlinear terms like the Coriolis and centrifugal forces are summed up. 
The generalized forces due to gravity, friction and elasticities are combined in _MATH_, _MATH_ describes the constraint forces and _MATH_ the motor torques.These are projected into the describing subsystem space by _MATH_.
In this paper, we have studied context inconsistency checking without central control in pervasive computing environments. 
Toward this objective, we have proposed DCCI: a scheme for Decentralized Checking Context Inconsistency, which checks context inconsistency by evaluating the constraints on the certain type of context instances and patterns over a shortcut structure. 
In order to construct the structure, DCCI first builds a simple overlay network and then leverages a preference-based locality. 
DCCI is a promising scheme for pervasive applications because it introduces a shortcut mechanism based on locality for performance enhancement. 
DCCI exploits the preference-based locality that nodes requiring the same context can check the inconsistency on this type of contexts. 
This locality can be tailored to according to the application requirements so as to achieve application goals.
Previous work ( e.g., _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_) found that variations in the macroscopic conditions of the background corona [ e.g., _MATH_ and _MATH_] affect electron beams and waves in type III sources, and hence the remote type III bursts. 
Here we explore the effects on the spectral characteristics of _MATH_ emission by varying the _MATH_ index of the background particle distributions. 
Following the predictions of _CITE_ and the suggestions of _CITE_ we assume that in the corona _MATH_ varies between 4 and 10.
Case-II High pass response: 
The transfer function is given in equation (_REF_). 
Here DC gain of the filter is one while high frequency gain is zero. 
The peak frequency _MATH_ can be calculated by solving the nonlinear equation given below. _MATHDISP_ Where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_.
In this section we make the previous discussion concrete by computing the polynomials _MATH_ when _MATH_ and _MATH_ have degree 1, hence correspond to irreducible polynomials _MATH_ and _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
The generic invariant _MATH_, that we shall abbreviate as _MATH_, has for projections in the algebras _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_ means that one sends the vector _MATH_ to _MATH_ by the first arrow, and _MATH_ to _MATH_ by the second arrow. 
To compute the generic product _MATH_ in _MATH_, it suffices to do so in _MATH_ by the discussion of the previous section. 
Take two partial isomorphisms _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
Among the _MATH_ possibilities for _MATH_, the vectors _MATH_ and _MATH_ are colinear in _MATH_ cases, the factor _MATH_ corresponding to the possibilities for the factor of proportionnality _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
In all these cases, _MATHDISP_ has type _MATH_. 
So, this situation contributes to a term _MATHDISP_ in _MATH_. 
In every other situation, _MATH_ and we have to compute trivial extensions. 
It should be noticed here that the form of _MATH_ is different when _MATH_ and when _MATH_. 
Therefore, we have several cases to treat separately, the most interesting being when _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Suppose then _MATH_ and _MATH_ not colinear. 
One has _MATHDISP_. 
So, outside the terms of _REF_, the remaining part of the product _MATH_ is equal to _MATHDISP_.
Note that in the derivations above, the only requirement for the distribution functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ (_MATH_) is continuity since the time to division or death is a continuous random variable. 
Therefore, gamma, lognormal or even exponential distributions can be plugged into the branching process models above. 
However, as in Hawkins et al. (2007), we will only consider the gamma distribution in this study due to its flexibility in shape (e.g., it could be non-bell shaped) and the comparison of different distribution functions are outside of the scope of this study. 
Finally, although a number of parameter estimation methods (e.g., the pseudo-likelihood estimator) have been proposed for branching process model fitting, the nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimator turns out to be the most robust one (Hyrien and Zand, 2008) and therefore is employed in this study for all types of models. 
Note that numerous alternative methods, such as the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) (Toni et al., 2009), can also be used for parameter estimation, but a thorough comparison and evaluation of all applicable estimation methods is out of the scope of this study.
For detailed treatment of general Dirichlet forms, the reader is referred to _CITE_. 
We consider that for the reachability problem studied in this section, it is not relevant to present the whole mathematical apparatus which characterises Dirichlet forms. 
Intuitively, Dirichlet forms are quadratic forms that encode the Markovian properties of the underlying process. 
The relevance of this theory in our study is that we can obtain results on the estimation of reachability probabilities using properties of the capacity associated to a Dirichlet form.
On the basis of Proposition _REF_ and Lemma _REF_, we can easily give the following example of a purely s.p. (i.e. not a periodic) function: _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, one can readily check that the function _MATH_ can be obtained as a uniform limit of the sequence _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a continuous _MATH_-periodic function: _MATHDISP_.
Minimise _MATH_ with respect to the variables _MATH_ and _MATH_ subject to (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_) where the scalar _MATH_ and _MATH_ are a-priori user-defined.
The same observational picture rises from the analysis of emerging small-scale loops in previous works (with comparable photospheric and chromospheric darkenings being a substantial difference the way the emerging fields interact, i.e. when in active regions emerging loops experience reconnection with ambient fields while in quiet sun regions they do not. 
Very small-scale flux emergence episodes are, for instance, detected in the quiet sun internetwork. 
In the Hinode data set analysed by _CITE_ dark features are seen in the chromospheric Ca ii H with similar properties as the ones we report in this work yet with a shorter lifetime of the order of 5 min and length scale of 1 to 2 Mm. 
These authors make use of linear polarization magnetic data to detect the very initial stage of emergence when the apex of the loops first reach the visible surface, even before the circular polarization signals from the footpoint (vertical fields) are detected. 
Nonetheless, in quiet sun observations the results point towards the emergence of individual loops rather than of more complex SAFS as reported in this work. 
Brightenings are also confined to the location of the footpoints and are not observed extending towards the other magnetic footpoint leading to brightness enhancements at the apex of the loops. 
The directivity of small-scale flux emergences found in the AR studied in this work is markedly different from internetwork emerging bipoles, which show no preferential orientation _CITE_. 
Some of the loops discovered in quiet sun regions in the above-mentioned works are observed reaching upper chromospheric layers. 
This suggest that reconnection at lower chromospheric layers might be less effective due to the loops entering a region with less ambient field that what is normally found within active regions. 
Physical process of granular-scale emergence of magnetic loops seems to be essentially the same in quiet sun and active regions and reduced chromospheric emission observed in quiet sun is attributed to reconnection less likely to occur. 
Further investigations should be carried out to conclude on this fact from the analysis of quiet sun and solar active regions observations and to determine more potential differences in the emerging process.
Remark. 
If _MATH_ is a finite group such that _MATH_ where _MATH_ and gcd _MATH_, then the Theorem _REF_ shows that the Sylow _MATH_-subgroups of _MATH_ are precisely those subgroups of order _MATH_. 
Moreover, every conjugate of a Sylow _MATH_-subgroup is a Sylow _MATH_-subgroup. 
Its converse is also true by the following Theorem _REF_.
Our reference model is the unidirectional pulse propagation equation (UPPE) _CITE_, that governs the forward component of linearly polarized pulses _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the Fourier transform of the laser electric field with respect to _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (_REF_) describes linear dispersion and diffraction of the pulse. 
The term _MATH_ contains the third-order nonlinear polarization _MATH_, whose magnitude is characterized by the Kerr index _MATH_ _MATH_, the electron current _MATH_ and a loss term _MATH_ due to ionization (see, e.g., _CITE_). 
Compared with _CITE_, the denominator of the nonlinear term reduces to _MATH_, as we consider optical waveforms with transverse dimensions satisfying the paraxial assumption _MATH_. 
For practical convenience, when going to time domain we transform to a reference frame moving with the linear group velocity of the pulse, _MATH_ where _MATH_, keeping the pulse center at zero delay. 
Third-harmonic generation results from the _MATH_ nonlinearity and higher-order odd harmonic cascading occurs from mixing pump and harmonic fields. 
The plasma dynamics is described by the electron density _MATHDISP_ with neutral atom density _MATH_. 
Because we are dealing with few-cycle pulses, we use a field dependent quasi-static tunneling ionization rate _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ GV/m is the atomic electric field strength, _MATH_ fs_MATH_ denotes the atomic frequency unit and _MATH_ _CITE_. 
Here, _MATH_ eV and _MATH_ eV are the ionization potentials of hydrogen and the atom under consideration, i.e., argon; _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the electron mass and charge, respectively. 
Equation (_REF_) applies to electric fields with maximum amplitude limited to _MATH_ GV/m. 
It also discards multiphoton ionization, being dominant for field amplitudes _MATH_ GV/m.
(d) If _MATH_ and _MATH_, then _MATH_. 
Proof. (a) By (_REF_) and (_REF_) we see that _MATH_. 
Then, by Lemma _REF_(b) and Lemma _REF_(a), we have _MATH_ for all the recurrent states _MATH_ under _MATH_. 
Hence, it follows from (_REF_) and (_REF_) that _MATH_ for all the recurrent states _MATH_ under _MATH_, which implies the second part of (a). 
Moreover, since _MATH_, by (_REF_) and a straightforward calculation we have _MATHDISP_, which together with (_REF_) gives _MATH_. 
Thus, by Theorem _REF_(a) and Lemma _REF_ (b) we have _MATHDISP_, and so the first part of (a) follows.
Let _MATH_ be the best possible parallel time complexity of Pan's LU-factorization algorithm. 
Then, we should have _MATHDISP_, assuming that we are provided with enough processors, so that the two recursions can be carried out simultaneously. 
Again, we assume that _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_, for some constant _MATH_ with base condition _MATH_. 
Then, we obtain _MATHDISP_.
In the multi-processor setting, jobs remain sequential in nature and cannot be executed by more than one processor in parallel. 
We distinguish schedules that would migrate jobs among processors from those that would not. 
Different online algorithms like _MATH_ and IMD _CITE_ that are _MATH_-competitive have been proposed respectively under the migratory and the non-migratory model, where _MATH_ is the ratio of the maximum job size to the minimum job size _CITE_. 
Furthermore, Chekuri et al. _CITE_ have shown that IMD is _MATH_-competitive when using processors _MATH_ times faster. 
If migration is allowed, _MATH_ can achieve a competitive ratio one or even smaller, when using sufficiently fast processors _CITE_. 
It is worth-mentioning that non-migratory algorithms are preferred in practice because migrating jobs requires overheads and is avoided in many applications.
The affine version of the orthogonal group gives the Euclidean (transformation) group: (The Euclidean group _MATH_). 
A Euclidean transformation _MATH_ from _MATH_ to _MATH_ is defined jointly by a matrix _MATH_ and a vector _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
The set of all such transformations is called the Euclidean group of dimension and is denoted by _MATH_.

Completing the derivation: 
It is now possible to substitute the expressions for _MATH_ and _MATH_ into the expression for _MATH_ in (_REF_): _MATHDISP_ Or, alternatively, by substituting for _MATH_ and _MATH_, it is possible to write (_REF_) in terms of _MATH_ only: _MATHDISP_
We show some propositions before proving Theorem _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ be the constant in Assumption (A.1). 
Remind that _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_, we have the following.
Negative binomial distribution is defined based on one-by-one counting on Bernoulli processes, and a large amount of work has been done on this distribution and related distributions such as binomial and Poisson distributions. 
See for example, Patil and Joshi (1968), Johnson and Kotz (1969), and the reference therein. 
Considerable efforts have been made in introducing generalized and compound distributions such as Neyman's Type A, Type B and Type C distributions, Thomas distribution, and Poisson binomial distribution (Ord 1970; Gurland 1957; Johnson et al. 2005; and the reference therein). 
These compound distributions are widely used to handle some special count data (Jackson 1972). 
However, all these distributions are defined based on recording events one by one, and a more general distribution is needed when counting is done group by group and the number of events is recorded only when counting of a group is completed. 
Such a need is illustrated by an example in the industry on manufacture of Smart Cards in a multinational company, where nonconforming cards occur very sparingly and the fraction nonconforming cards produced is as low as a few hundred p.p.m. (parts per million) or lower. 
In this example, in accordance with a contract agreement between the manufacturer and the customer, Smart Cards produced are tested in lots each of size _MATH_, the number of nonconforming cards are recorded only when testing of a lot is completed, and the fraction nonconforming _MATH_ of the cards produced is estimated only when a sufficient number (20 or more, in this case) of nonconforming cards are accumulated. 
In this situation, the number of lots tested and the number of nonconforming cards recorded are both random variables, and unbiased estimator or maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of _MATH_ cannot be derived using previously known discrete distributions. 
Therefore, a new bivariate distribution has to be developed to handle this situation.
Apart from low mass stars (_MATH_), main sequence stars burn hydrogen inside a convective core where matter is fully mixed. 
This leads to a mean molecular weight constant throughout the core and increasing with time as hydrogen is transformed into helium. 
In between this core and the homogeneous envelope, a region of varying mean molecular weight (_MATH_-gradient region) builds up, whose detailed shape is of crucial importance for asteroseismic studies. 
It induces indeed a growing peak in the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and permits the appearance of so-called mixed modes whose detection bears in turn the signature of the structure of these layers. 
Some physical processes may alter the shape of the _MATH_-gradient mostly through a full or partial mixing of some radiatively stable layers above the limit of the convective core. 
This is the case for rotation, overshooting, semiconvection and diffusion. 
We shall here mainly focus on the mixing induced by overshooting and we shall briefly address the problem of semiconvection in small mass main sequence stars.
While PI models were clearly better in our example, that assessment was based on distance sampling assumptions. 
The lack of fit associated with FI could also result from failures of the assumptions. 
First, the observed pattern could appear if birds were truly at higher density near the point center because point locations were not selected at random relative to bird distribution. 
Second, if observers routinely underestimated distance, more birds could be recorded near the point center that were really farther away. 
Finally, attractive or random movement prior to detection would inflate the number of birds near the point center. 
All distance sampling assumptions, other than _MATH_ must hold for MRDS. 
We believe all of the MRDS assumptions are quite reasonable for our golden-cheeked warbler example. 
Points were selected randomly from within patches of woodland habitat, observers were trained in distance estimation and only needed to assign distances to one of two bins and the effect of any movement was reduced by restricting the counts to a 5 minute interval. 
If the MRDS assumptions are likely to fail for a particular application, one alternative is using mark-recapture with distance as a covariate. 
If that is the only viable option, we recommend collecting as many relevant detection covariates as possible with the knowledge that abundance estimates may be negatively biased due to unmodelled heterogeneity.
Based on this Definition, we can reduce each term _MATH_ into a unique arrow in _MATH_ by an unfolding of _MATH_, as follows: _MATHDISP_ 
The unfolding of a simple binary tree-term in _MATH_, with the node _TIMES_ (or _MATH_) and the leafs _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_ where the paths _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the compositions of the unary operations in _MATH_, into a simple path tree with a unique leaf _MATH_, is presented by: _MATHDISP_ 
Let us consider now the unfolding of the 'update' operations _MATH_ (i.e. 'EXTEND...') along the paths composed of unary operations in _MATH_, as follows: 
The unfolding of an operation _MATH_ along a path composed of unary operations in _MATH_, for a given term _MATH_ and corresponding relational symbol _MATH_, such that _MATH_, _MATH_, is defined by the following cases: _MATH_ RENAME _MATH_ AS _MATH_, where _MATH_ is obtained from _MATH_ by substitution of _MATH_ with _MATH_.
This result has no counterpart in usual probability, and, as said in the previous section, this is the consequence of our definition of the expectation which sends an operator to an operator, not to a number.
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be the highest nonnegative integer such that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
(In the case where _MATH_, _MATH_ and so _MATH_.) 
Notice that _MATH_ and since _MATH_, we have _MATH_. 
We distinguish three following cases.
The dm-m wave emission consisted of a type IV continuum, the metre wave counterparts of the dekametre-hectometre (DH) type III groups and of the type II bursts.
The frequency response of the target IIR filter and the designed IIR filter are depicted in the figure Fig. _REF_. 
It can be seen that the designed frequency response is very close to that of the desired filter. 
Moreover, the poles of the transfer function of the IIR filter are depicted in Fig. _REF_. 
It is also obvious that all the poles lie inside the disk _MATH_. 
That is, the CSD coded IIR filter is robustly _MATH_.
Introduce the cylindrical random variables _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_. 
Observe, that since _REF_ gives an explicit form of the characteristic function of _MATH_ in terms of the Levy measure, we easily find that _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
We can extend these random variables to _MATH_ by a standard limit argument choosing a sequence _MATH_ converging in _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
The limit of _MATH_ exists in _MATH_ and will be denoted _MATH_. 
The limit is independent of the choice of approximating sequence. 
In particular, we can define _MATH_ for bounded Borel sets _MATH_. 
We make the following definition. 
For every bounded Borel subset _MATH_ of _MATH_, define the random measure _MATHDISP_. 
We show that _MATH_ defines a Levy basis (see Proposition _REF_) and that it is homogeneous (see Proposition _REF_). 
The random measure _MATH_ is a Levy basis, with mean zero and variance _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the Lebesgue measure of _MATH_, and the associated control measure of _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_. 
The random measure _MATH_ has mean zero and variance equal to _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the Lebesgue measure of the set _MATH_. 
We show that _MATH_ has the additivity and independence properties.
We analyze the quantitative importance of general equilibrium effects by simulating optimal non-linear income taxes and education subsidies. 
We find that the marginal top rate is negative, and rather small for plausible elasticities of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor, which confirms the findings of _CITE_. 
Optimal education subsidies are not large either, since there is a direct link between the top rate and education subsidies. 
However, we demonstrate quantitatively that general equilibrium should be exploited for redistribution when the elasticity of substitution between skilled and unskilled labor is very low.
Pump pulses (fluence _MATH_ 40 _MATH_J/cm_MATH_) were focused on the surface of a 300 _MATH_m thick gold film deposited on a SiO_MATH_ substrate with a lens of 30 cm focal length and an incidence angle of 10_MATH_. 
Probe pulses with variable time delays relative to pump pulses were used to measure time-resolved transient reflection produced by the pump pulses. 
The white light continuum was split into two beams (probe and reference) and, after reflection from the sample, directed into two diode arrays attached to spectrometers (Model 77400, Oriel). 
According to _CITE_, at early times after 100 fs laser excitation, the normalized reflectivity change _MATH_ is proportional to the normalized temperature change of the electron gas _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, the surface reflectivity kinetics were obtained and assigned to the surface temperature variations.
Now, if _MATH_ then _MATH_ defines a constant section _MATH_ of _MATH_ and, using (_REF_), (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_), we have that the left-invariant and the right-invariant vector fields _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, on _MATH_ are defined by _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_.
Despite the above contrasts Figures _REF_(a)-_REF_(d) also show striking similarities between S1 and S3. 
Specifically, we see that both beams peak at similar _MATH_ when they both exist (_MATH_ s), and the _MATH_ waves at the corresponding _MATH_ are strongest. 
These similarities are expected, since identical electron injection is imposed for both cases. 
Consequently, for both S1 and S3 early in their evolutions the beams and _MATH_ waves have large _MATH_ and the corresponding _MATH_ is small. 
In particular, Figures _REF_(b) and _REF_(d) show that _MATH_ for _MATH_ s, where _MATH_ _CITE_, with _MATH_ m_MATH_ here. 
The wavenumber _MATH_ affects strongly the rates of ES and EM decays (_CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_), and so the remote type III emission ( e.g., _CITE_).
The diffusion phenomenon is governed by the linear heat diffusion equation: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the thermal diffusivity. 
For convenience, it is chosen an isothermal and null state : _MATHDISP_ 
The boundary conditions are: _MATHDISP_. with _MATH_ the thermal conductivity of a material. 
Knowing that: _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ the density and _MATH_ the specific heat, the expression of the temperature in the Laplace domain is: _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ and _MATH_, which clearly shows that the temperature _MATH_ is linked to the flux _MATH_ though a transfer function with a half order integral (_MATH_) and an exponential of a half order derivative. 
The closer to the heated front end, the smaller _MATH_, and the more negligible the exponential term. 
Evaluating the _MATH_ order Pad√© approximation of the exponential term yields: _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_, where the exponents of _MATH_ are multiples of the commensurate order 0.5. 
The obtained fractional model remains linear as long as the thermal parameters are constant, i.e. for small temperature variations around the initial state. 
Generalizing the transfer function between the flux and the temperature, equation _REF_ may be written as : _MATHDISP_. 
Such an expression, with a commensurable order of 0.5, was obtained for finite or semi-finite diffusive phenomena in planar, cylindrical and spherical geometric configurations in _CITE_.
In the previous paragraphs we discussed the general syntax of WSML logical expressions. 
Each variant poses some restriction on the use of specific connectives and on the usage of modeling constructs.
Please list different true loss functions used in previous work, and compare their pros and cons as the true loss for ranking.
In this case, Protocol 1 has to be tweaked slightly: instead of choosing _MATH_ uniformly in _MATH_, which does not make sense for _MATH_, we choose the entries as uniform _MATH_-bit numbers. 
This choice ensures both that _MATH_ will be statistically close to uniform in _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_, and that the entries in _MATH_ will be statistically close to uniform _MATH_-bit numbers. 
This follows from the fact that the entries in _MATH_ will be at most _MATH_ times bigger than the ones of _MATH_ because _MATH_ is an _MATH_-matrix with all entries in _MATH_. 
Thus, the entries of _MATH_ are at most _MATH_ if the entries of _MATH_ are smaller than _MATH_.
The confidentiality and integrity protections provided by the network layer are in an embarrassing situation as discussed below. 
On one hand, many applications that do not want to such protection just avoid using these functions due to their computational expense. 
On the other hand, those applications requiring these security protections prefer to adopting the same protection provided by the transport layer since they are end-to-end based. 
This is because the application layer cannot be assured of that the same protection can be provided by every network segment all the way from source to destination. 
If any of them fails in doing so, the end-to-end security may be compromised. 
Therefore, the network layer should focus on providing security protections that cannot be provided by higher layers.
The genetic fuzzy system with force based measurement deltas gives a success rate of 100 percent at the noise level of 0.05. 
For a noise level of 0.1, the genetic fuzzy system with force based measurement deltas gives an average success rate of 99 percent and a minimum success rate of 91.3 percent (Severe D/D) and starts falling for higher noise levels of 0.15 and 0.20 by giving average success rates of 96 percent and 89.8 percent and minimum success rates of 76 percent and 63.90 percent, respectively. 
The genetic fuzzy system with force based measurement deltas gives 100 percent success rate for both the key rules even at a higher noise level of 0.15.
For standing kink modes supported by flowing slabs, the flow is found to significantly reduce the period ratios _MATH_ for all of the considered density contrasts _MATH_. 
This is true even when _MATH_ is very large (the solid curves in Figure _REF_), in which case while for static slabs _MATH_ almost reaches the analytically expected lower limit _MATH_, they may be reduced by _MATH_ for _MATH_ being _MATH_ for the Alfven Mach number _MATH_ in the range of _MATH_. 
For lower, and therefore more realistic, density contrasts, the flow effect is even stronger.
One solution is to replace the noise pixel by themean value of the neighbors. 
Say we use the eight nearest neighbors for the noise pixel at position _MATH_ in the image patch in figure _REF_. 
The mean value is then: _MATHDISP_
If the evolving curve stabilizes as _MATH_ then it must approach its limit set, which must in turn be an MEP. 
This happens, for example, for the simple double-well potential shown in Fig. _REF_(a).
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ designate the nondimensional perturbations of the velocity, magnetic induction and pressure, respectively determined by the presence of a thin insulating airfoil whose equation is _MATHDISP_.
_REF_ discovered by Hind (1856), as its eruption in 1855, is the prototype of a subclass of dwarf novae and then has been studied extensively photometrically and spectroscopically (e.g., Echevarria et al. 2007 and references therein). 
It is important to our understanding of the structure and the evolution of Cataclysmic Variables. 
Dwarf novae are cataclysmic variables (CVs) that undergo quasi-period outbursts of about 4-6 magnitudes, and based on the study of _REF_, Warner and Nather (1971) and Smak (1971) independently established the classical model for nonmagnetic CVs.
As remarked earlier, the ISS property was introduced for finite-dimensional systems described by ODEs in [22]. 
It was quickly generalized to ISpS (input-to-state practical stability) and IOpS (input-to-output practical stability) in [7] for finite-dimensional systems described by ODEs. 
The work [26, 27] presents equivalent characterizations of IOS. 
The WIOS and WISS properties were introduced in [14, 15] for a wide class of systems and were based on the work centered around "non-uniform in time IOS" and "non-uniform in time ISS" in [10-13, 19]. 
As it is pointed out in [28] the IOS and ISS properties have been proved to be very useful in Mathematical Control Theory for a very important reason: it combines features of internal stability properties (Lyapunov stability looking at the effect of initial conditions for zero-input response) with features of external stability properties (input-output stability looking at the effect of nonzero inputs for zero-state response) proposed earlier in the literature; see the work of Zames, Willems and others [28].
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In section 6, we will express them explicitly in terms of the theta functions. 
We note the following analogues the Jacobi elliptic functions: _MATHDISP_.
This result was quite amazing and prompted us to test it in a different way. 
Instead of using random starting points we chose again 200 starting points, but now chosen on a regular grid covering the same rectangular region _MATH_. 
This yielded sensibly the same results, with only a few small differences, but never yielding more local optima than with the random starts. 
This conforted us in the correctness of our first results.
For completeness, we also study Gluskin and Milman's equal weights modification of the GM-AM ratio: _MATH_. 
Here the natural choice of probability is the uniform measure _MATH_ on _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the _MATH_ norm on _MATH_. 
For _MATH_ and on _MATH_, the preceding ratio concentrates around _MATH_.
Proof. 
If possible, suppose that (_REF_) has a nonoscillatory solution _MATH_ satisfying the property _MATH_ for large _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ in (_REF_). 
Suppose that _MATH_ and _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
From Lemma 1.2 due to Kiguradze and Chanturia [129], it follows for _MATH_, that _MATHDISP_, that is, _MATHDISP_, for some _MATH_. 
Then there exists a _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Hence for _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Taking limit sup., we obtain a contradiction. 
Hence _MATH_. 
The theorem is proved.
The second-harmonic generation system is very useful to investigate the processes of synchronization and control of chaotic states, so more detailed analysis in this area should be continued.
We denote the elementary symmetric polynomials of _MATH_-th degree in _MATH_ by _MATH_ and _MATH_ will also be denoted by _MATH_.
In every maximal Darboux arrangement of order four with two (nonparallel) non-standard twin pairs, at least one line of each pair must contain a standard vertex.
The lot sizing and scheduling with sequence dependencies problem has been treated frequently with models that subdivide a period in microperiods. 
Division of the planning horizon in discrete periods reflects commercial, such as demand requirements, or accounting aspects, such as holding stock costs. 
However, subdivision of each period in a fixed number of microperiods is a modeling strategy, to which we alternatively propose another one. 
In our approach, the lot sizing module defines production lots without any time subdivision within a period, and the scheduling model uses the time within a period in a continuous fashion, deciding the starting time of each production lot.
We want to describe processes where the initial state is a proton that absorbs a virtual photon transforming into a final state corresponding to an excited hadronic state of spin _MATH_. 
So we consider the interaction action _MATHDISP_. where _MATH_ represents the initial proton, that we take as the state with lowest mass level, corresponding to _MATH_. 
So the initial momentum _MATH_ satisfies _MATH_. 
The fermionic field _MATH_ represents a final state with (higher) mass _MATH_ and momentum _MATH_ satisfying _MATH_, where we are representing as _MATH_ the integer associated with the excitation level of the final state. 
The corresponding solutions have the form _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the spins of the initial and final fermionic states.
In other words, the onset of cracking is necessarily brutal when _MATH_. 
At the critical load when the first cracking occurs, the crack will be initiated on all or a part of the length L. 
In the latter case, the two equations _REF_ giving the initiation length and the initiation loading can be interpreted as follows:
Panel data involve at least two dimensions, a cross-sectional dimension and a time series dimension. 
Under normal circumstances one would expect that the computation of panel data estimator or inference would be more complicated than cross-sectional or time series data. 
However, in certain cases, the availability of panel data actually simplifies computation and inference. 
For instance:
From this discussion, we can state the following theorem. 
In an _MATH_, given _MATH_ pairs of distinct nodes _MATH_ (_MATH_), we can find _MATH_ mutually node-disjoint paths _MATH_ of lengths at most _MATH_ in _MATH_ time. 
This can be deduced from Lemmas _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_.
(Borsuk Theorem)(Page 58 in _CITE_) Assume that _MATH_ is a real Banach space. 
Let _MATH_ be a symmetric bounded open region with _MATH_. 
Assume that _MATH_ is completely continuous and odd with _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is odd.
Let _MATH_ be the ring of Laurent polynomials in _MATH_, and _MATH_ be the _MATH_-modules generated by the following rational functions of _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATH_ be the part of _MATH_ consisting of the skew-symmetric elements _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ denote the skew-symmetrization _MATHDISP_.
(2) _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, here _MATH_ are negative constants. 
Suppose that _MATH_-_MATH_ hold. 
Then the set _MATHDISP_ is bounded in _MATH_. 
Proof. 
For _MATH_, by _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ 
Since _MATH_, then _MATH_. 
Then we can see, from the condition _MATH_, that there exist constants _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
So we can see, from (_REF_) and (_REF_), that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Then for _MATH_, and _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
_MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, for _MATH_, we have that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Substitute (_REF_) and (_REF_) into (_REF_), then we have _MATHDISP_. 
It means that _MATHDISP_, similarly, _MATHDISP_. 
Substitute the above two into (_REF_) and (_REF_), we can see that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
From the condition _MATH_, (_REF_) and (_REF_) give that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are bounded, then _MATH_ and _MATH_ are also bounded. 
Thus, by the definition of the norm on _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are bounded. 
That is, _MATH_ is bounded in _MATH_. 
_MATH_ 
Suppose that the condition _MATH_ is hold. 
Then the set _MATHDISP_ is bounded in _MATH_. 
Proof. 
For _MATH_, we have that _MATH_, where _MATH_ 
Since _MATH_, so we have _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
From _MATH_, there exist positive constants _MATH_ such that for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, it means that _MATH_. 
And for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, it means that _MATH_. 
So, we can see that for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
The above two arguments imply that _MATH_ is bounded. 
As the same way, _MATH_ is bounded. 
Thus, _MATH_ is bounded in _MATH_._MATH_ 
The set _MATHDISP_ is bounded in _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the linear isomorphism given by _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Proof. 
For _MATH_ , set _MATH_, then _MATH_ implies that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
From (_REF_) and (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_, the condition (_MATH_) gives that _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. it is a contradiction. 
As a result, there exist positive constants _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Similarly, from (_REF_)-(_REF_) and the second part of (1) or (2)of (_MATH_), there exist two positive constants _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
It follows that _MATH_ are bounded, that is, _MATH_ is bounded in _MATH_. 
Any of the five invariant reductions implies symmetry constraints on the function _MATH_ at the leading order of the decomposition (_REF_). 
For instance, if _MATH_, then _MATH_ is _MATH_-antiperiodic with respect to both _MATH_ and _MATH_; if _MATH_, then _MATH_ is _MATH_-antiperiodic in _MATH_ and _MATH_-periodic in _MATH_, and so on. 
By the completeness results of Proposition _REF_, all other terms of the decomposition (_REF_) which violate the symmetry constraints on the solution _MATH_ can be set to be identically zero. 
By the Implicit Function Theorem, the zero solution is unique near _MATH_. 
Therefore, the series (_REF_) shrinks to fewer terms, the reduction persists for sufficiently small _MATH_, and the proof of Theorem _REF_ applies. 
Stabilizing Boundary Control: 
The boundary control _REF_ and _REF_ are simulated with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The 3D spatial time representation for the boundary control is shown in Fig. _REF_ and the position, control and tension at the top (crane) and bottom (subsea payload) boundaries are shown in Figs. _REF_ and _REF_ respectively. 
From the simulations, it is observed that the proposed boundary control can stabilize the boundary at the origin under the influence of the disturbances.
When _MATH_ is an arbitrary probability measure on _MATH_, it may give positive mass to sets of trees with infinitely many nodes. 
First we state the strong law of large numbers for random elements taking values in a compact metric space given in Sverdrup-Thygeson (1981). 
This covers the space of trees with infinite number of vertices. 
Then we show that the metric space _MATH_ is compact; this implies in particular that the expected tree is well defined (_MATH_ is non empty).
We consider the Stieltjes transforms _MATH_ for _MATH_ of _MATH_ as follows _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_ (see also [13]). 
The Stieltjes transforms _MATH_ of _MATH_ play an important role in spectral analysis for orthogonal polynomials.
Coordinate system and matrix handle the CTM by combining translations, rotations, reflections, inclinations and scale reductions/enlargements.
In order to verify the correctness of our approximated solution achieved by multiple scales method, we compare the results of direct integration of the full motion equation _REF_ with the steady state solution of the evolution equation _REF_. 
We use the results from Tables _REF_ and _REF_ for _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
We also estimate the effective mass _MATH_ to be _MATH_, the effective capacitance to be of order of _MATH_, the DC voltage _MATH_, the AC voltage _MATH_, and take the distance _MATH_ to be the actual distance between the electrode and the mechanical beam, i.e., _MATH_. 
The resulting excitation force amplitude is _MATH_, the constant force is _MATH_ (see Eq. _REF_), and the constant resonance frequency shift is _MATH_ (see Eq. _REF_).
If the Laplace transfer function of _MATH_ is _MATH_, the Laplace transfer of the fractional order operators by the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo definitions are given as _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
If the initial condition of _MATH_ is zero, the Laplace transfer functions have the same form, since the sum in the right hand side of equation (_REF_) and (_REF_) is removed. 
Then, Laplace transfer of the _MATH_ order operation is _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ be the pseudoscalar for 4d 'spherical' space. 
Show that _MATH_ and that it commutes with all vectors in the space.
Further quantitative insight has been gained studying the spectra in the framework of the blast wave model _CITE_: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and a linear velocity profile was assumed: _MATH_. 
The slopes of the _MATH_ spectra define lines in the _MATH_ plane. 
_MATH_ is varied in the window 90-140 MeV. 
Transverse momentum distributions are then generated using eq. (_REF_), with _MATH_ values tuned in order to reproduce the observed _MATH_ values. 
Fig. _REF_ shows the results for the _MATH_ and also for the negative charged hadrons (essentially pions), _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ _CITE_. 
The study is performed for _MATH_ in order to exclude the rise in the low _MATH_ region seen in the _MATH_ excess spectra _CITE_. 
In addition, to perform a comparison with meaningful statistical accuracy with the other particles, data were integrated in centrality, excluding the most peripheral events. 
A clear hierarchy in the freeze out parameters, as a consequence of the particle coupling to the medium is visible. 
The _MATH_ is the least coupled particle, while the _MATH_, being continuously produced in the medium via _MATH_- annihilation is maximally coupled. 
The freeze-out component of the _MATH_ receives the strongest radial flow boost, with a _MATH_ MeV, 50 MeV above the _MATH_ _CITE_.
Inadequate input/output pairing, ignoring mutual interactions between the system variables, competing controllers, insufficient degrees of freedom, the presence of strong non-linearities and the lack of time-delay compensation in the system are frequently found as sources for control-structure problems. 
If not properly addressed by means of feedforward control actions, external disturbances may also deteriorate the control performance. 
In the experience of the author, PID control is often used for systems with dominant time delays, instead of the more suitable time-delay compensators, i.e. Smith predictor, internal model control or even model predictive control. 
We also often find controllers operating with fixed settings for the whole operating range enforcing very conservative tunings. 
Implementing just gain-scheduling (as a special case adaptive control) in these situations would significantly improve the control performance.
The decision on whether _MATH_ is an anomaly is made based on a run-time anomaly measure _MATH_, defined as: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is a cumulative factor determining how important the visual information extracted from the current frame is for anomaly detection, and _MATH_. 
Compared to using _MATH_ as an indicator of normality, _MATH_ places more weight on more recent observations. 
Anomaly is detected at frame _MATH_ if _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is an anomaly detection threshold. 
The value of _MATH_ should be set according to a joint requirement on both the detection rate, namely the model sensitivity, and the false alarm rate, namely the model specificity. 
It takes a time delay for _MATH_ to stabilise at the beginning of evaluating a probe behaviour pattern due to the nature of the forward-backward procedure.
The sum of the moments about any given point _MATH_ along the link must also be zero. 
Since the moments are created by forces, it is convenient to use a similar subscript naming convention as used above for the forces themselves, with a slight change in the meaning of the superscript: it now denotes the point in the sidestay rotation plane about which moments are taken, and length _MATH_ is the moment arm of force _MATH_. 
The general expression for this moment equilibrium condition therefore is: _MATHDISP_.
The natural continuation of this observation is that a sufficient amount of consecutive zero feedback bits will eventually flush the carry registers so that they contain only zeros. 
On average, roughly half of the carry registers contain ones to start with, so an FCSR with _MATH_ active carry registers requires roughly _MATH_ zero feedback bits to flush the ones away with probability _MATH_. 
By expected value we therefore require roughly _MATH_ zero feedback bits to flush a register completely. 
For the X-FCSR family we have _MATH_, indicating that we need no more than nine zero feedback bits to flush a register.
The implementation of a scaling web-services show that MLN can function as an enabler for advanced behavior. 
The scaling algorithm used was basic but was able to adapt and increase in the rate of incoming conections based on prior knowledge. 
Using a-priori knowledge of a individual nodes performance for determining the quota per node might seem static and contrast to approaches that rely on machine learning. 
However, in a system administration context, the service administrator may already have priori knowledge from when the service was tested during its developement and deployment before it went into production. 
It is therefore reasonable to assume that performance bondaries are known in many contexts. 
It is outside of the scope of this work to fine-tune the scaling algorithm used for optimal performance. 
Instead, the point is that different algorithms can be implemented and exchanged with transparency to the instance management layer.
Equation (_REF_) is henceforth referred to as the two-handle sensitivity equation for the body _MATH_. 
One more equation is needed to calculate the value of _MATH_ which is obtained by differentiating equation (_REF_) with respect to the design variable _MATH_ and can be written in the following form.
Although the analysis of the limit _MATH_ corresponds to infinitesimal values for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, the numerical simulations suggest that Particle Number Dependence and the two variable approximation are in close agreement with the Interval Model if only _MATH_; _MATH_ and _MATH_ may be _MATH_. 
Run 2 uses _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Results shown in the second row of Fig. _REF_ are averages of _MATH_ simulations. 
Large numbers of simulations were required in runs 2 and 4 in order to obtain accurate estimates of _MATH_, since simultaneous occupation of sites 1 and _MATH_ was rare. 
For run 2, simulated averages of _MATH_ and _MATH_ are in excellent agreement with the Two Variable Approximation and simulated averages of _MATH_ are in excellent agreement with Particle Number Dependence.
For the last ten years, local helioseismology methods have provided a way to map medium-to-large active regions on the non-visible hemisphere of the Sun using information carried by waves that propagate all the way from the far side to the near side, where these waves are observed _CITE_. 
The waves that pass through areas of strong magnetic field experience a phase shift _CITE_ that is measurable when compared with a model representing waves that propagate between two points in the quiet photosphere. 
Maps of the difference between the model and the measured phase shift present large perturbations in those areas of concentrated magnetic field, such as active regions. 
Seismic maps calculated using this technique are currently used as another space weather forecasting tool and are available at _URL_ and _URL_.
We let _MATH_ be the set of possible variants. 
In this work, we focus on two possible choices for _MATH_. 
In the first, which we label as _MATH_, we consider every possible combination of epitopes. 
For example, if _MATH_ we define _MATHDISP_. 
In the second choice, which we label as _MATH_, we consider only variants that, from left to right, contain a sequence of all 1's followed by a sequence of all 0's. 
In the case _MATH_ we define _MATHDISP_
The influence of user on the MEG and correlation as seen in Fig. _REF_ and Table _REF_ are directly translated to capacity performance for the studied SIMO and MIMO setups. 
The SIMO and MIMO capacities are lower at the low frequency band (see Fig. _REF_). 
The user influence in the three interaction scenarios has different impact on the capacity depending on the alternation of the correlation, MEG and gain balance between the antenna branches in the dual antenna system. 
As an example, at the frequency of _MATH_ MHz, despite the decrease in correlation by almost half, the SIMO and MIMO capacities for the user hand interaction scenario show a decrease of _MATH_ as compared to free space. 
This is due to significant individual decrease in MEGs (_MATH_ and _MATH_), as well as the increase in the difference between the MEGs of the two antenna branches. 
At _MATH_ MHz, the user head only case shows the best performance, due to the lowest change in MEGs (_MATH_ and _MATH_) and a good balance between the MEGs of the antenna ports. 
The correlation at the high frequency band is low for all the user interaction cases. 
It should be noted that the performance evaluation is carried out under the assumption of uniform 3D APS channel.
Theorem 8.1.3. 
Suppose _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, we have the following solutions of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations (8.1.1)-(8.1.2): (1) _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ (2) _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_
Let _MATH_, and let its binary representation be _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ _MATH_. 
Substitute into Eq. (5.b), we derive _MATHDISP_
Prove that the _MATH_-contact process has a unique homogeneous eigenmeasure with eigenvalue _MATH_, which is the long-time limit law of the process started with one infected site distributed according to counting measure on _MATH_.
Following _CITE_, in the case of evanescent waves, the temperature fluctuations extracted at fixed geometrical height are dominated by the contribution due to the combination of the wave vertical displacement with the steep temperature gradient present in the low photosphere. 
In this section we describe this effect starting from the equations for linear stellar oscillations. 
The goal is to present a quantitative and sound base for reviewing the interpretation of _MATH_ and _MATH_ helioseismic spectra in both the _MATH_- and _MATH_-frames.
Combined with the force direction and the, the new force is defined as: _MATHDISP_.
In Figure _REF_, the 'shaded' area is the region in which the initial conditions _MATH_ must lie for a sliding motion to occur. 
Elsewhere the observer fails to provide converging state estimations. 
The shaded region is sometimes referred to as the sliding patch _CITE_. 
Of course the size of the shaded area can be enlarged by increasing the value of _MATH_, but for practical reasons, that may be undesirable.
A second way would be to add a new I/O control (_REF_ioctl) procedure to the underlying file system. 
An application that wishes to create a shared file invokes the _REF_ioctl that, in turns, calls the _REF_MakeSharedFileKey procedure. 
Finally, it is possible to define a new device and issue read and write operations on the device to read the output and to pass the input to the procedure.
To solve this optimization problem, the following algorithm can be used:
The result in Lemma _REF_ is closely related to Lemma _REF_, noting that the output power spectral density of the innovations model _REF_-_REF_ is given by: _MATHDISP_ where the spectral factor _MATH_ is given by _REF_ and _MATH_ is the (constant) spectral density of the innovations sequence.
Approximation for fractional order operation by CFE method
If _MATH_ is a finitely generated group and _MATH_ is a finite symmetric generating set, then we let _MATH_ denote the usual graph distance of _MATH_ to the origin in the Cayley graph _MATH_, i.e., _MATH_. 
The norm _MATH_ depends on the choice of _MATH_, but any two norms associated with different finite symmetric generating sets are equivalent. 
It follows from subadditivity that the limit _MATH_ exists; one says that the group _MATH_ has exponential (resp. subexponential) growth if this limit is positive (resp. zero). 
Note that since norms associated with different finite symmetric generating sets are equivalent, having (sub)exponential growth is a property of the group _MATH_ only and does not depend on the choice of _MATH_.
We use the fact that, as has been shown in Sec. _REF_, measuring the critical frequency detuning _MATH_ is a reliable way to estimate the value of _MATH_. 
In our case, if the nonlinear damping was negligible, the critical frequency detuning would be equal to _MATH_ (see Eq. _REF_). 
However, the experimental value _MATH_ is more than _MATH_ larger, suggesting non negligible nonlinear damping.
(i) When _MATH_no private insurance will be bought in the laissez faire.(ii) Let _MATH_ denote the critical level of the loading factor such that an individual with wage _MATH_ chooses in the laissez-faire a strictly positive level of private insurance if and only if _MATH_. 
Under Assumption _REF_, _MATH_ decreases with _MATH_.
Before stating some fundamental results for non-perfect case, we note that our perfect teleportation is obviously treated in general finite Hilbert spaces _MATH_ same as usual one. 
Moreover, our teleportation scheme can be a bit generalized by introducing the entangled state _MATH_ on _MATH_ defining the projections _MATH_ by the unitary operators _MATH_. 
We here discuss the perfect teleportation on general Hilbert spaces _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be CONS of the Hilbert space _MATH_. 
Define the entangled states _MATH_ and _MATH_ on _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, such as _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
By a sequence _MATH_ in _MATH_ with the properties (_REF_) and (_REF_), we define the unitary operator _MATH_ and _MATH_ such as _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ (mod _MATH_. 
Then the set _MATH_ of the projections of Alice is given by _MATHDISP_, and the teleportation channels _MATH_ are defined as _MATHDISP_. 
Finally the unitary keys _MATH_ of Bob are given as _MATHDISP_ by which we obtain the perfect teleportation _MATHDISP_. 
The above perfect teleportation is unique in the sense of unitary equivalence.
As can be seen from Fig. _REF_, the bisphere and the surrounding medium are quickly heating up and, as a result, the elasticity modulus of a polymeric adlayer decreases which leads to bisphere collapse (that is, to direct contact of metal cores) under the action of the Van-der-Waals forces. 
The resonance frequency _MATH_ decreases with the inter-particle distance _MATH_. 
Therefore, if initially the laser was in resonance with the bisphere (_MATH_), the system dynamics results in effective detuning at later moments in time. 
When this happens, absorption of laser radiation is decreased and the bisphere temperature starts to decrease as well. 
At the moment of collapse (_MATH_), the lattice temperature _MATH_ becomes less than the temperature of melting _MATH_ of the particle material. 
Thus, we see that the resonant frequencies _MATH_ and _MATH_ decrease as a result of interaction of laser radiation with a bisphere.
Irregular reduction is a key computation pattern in many complex dynamics simulations. 
In a typical dynamics simulator, the interactions among molecules or mesh points are computed pair-wise and the changes from multiple interactions are accumulated to corresponding molecules and mesh points. 
The code fragment in Code _REF_ is an excerpt from moldyn, a molecular dynamics kernel. 
In this piece of code, the array positions and force are indexed through the values in the other array interactions. 
Since the same element of the array force may be updated at different iterations according to the value of the array interactions, loop-carried data dependencies may arise. 
In spite of the possible loop-carried dependencies, the iterations are permutable since the order of applying additive operation does not affect to the result. 
Applying an associative operation to a set of values, called reduction, can be reordered and grouped in any sequence without changing the result. 
The indirect indexing of data arrays and the reduction operation characterize this example as an irregular reduction. 
If reduction operations are the only sources of loop-carried dependencies in a reduction loop, iterations of the loop can be reordered and thus the loop can be parallelized. 
But unlike data parallel loops, we must still take race conditions into account since multiple iterations may update the same memory location. 
There have been many solutions proposed to parallelize irregular reduction. 
We may summarize previous work as in Table _REF_.
The primary treatments of prostate cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and cryoablation, which are used alone or in combination [29]. 
Tumor cells of prostate cancer are crucially hormone-sensitive, which means they depend on the male hormone (androgen) for tumor growth. 
In this paper, we focus on hormone therapy of prostate cancer, or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) which can be achieved easily by medical castration (see [22, 23] and references therein). 
Total androgen blockage (TAB) which further combines anti-androgens with castration is also widely used.
Now let us prove Theorem _REF_. 
Remind that _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be stopping time given by _MATH_. 
By the Storong Markov Property of _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
So we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Integrating both sides by _MATH_, we see that _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_.
The _CITE_ WMAP 5 year paper considers the possibility of parity-violating interactions between photons and dark matter.
To further reduce flickering artifacts, Lin et al. _CITE_ propose to create a damped system between marks adjacent in space and time, and to minimize the energy of this system. 
They also try to minimize marks insertions and deletions using two passes. 
Disoccluded regions emerging during the forward pass are not rendered immediately, but deferred until they reach a sufficient size. 
Then, they are painted and the gaps are completed by backward propagation. 
Lin's damped spring model is discussed in greater detail within _REF_.
The gyroradius of an electron with energy of about _MATH_ keV in magnetic field _MATH_ is about _MATH_ m, while the gyroradius of a proton with the energy of about _MATH_ MeV is about _MATH_ m. 
The presence of a strong axial field means that magnetic nulls never develop and, hence, both proton and electron gyro-radii are much smaller than the scale length _MATH_. 
Therefore, the guiding centre approximation is applicable in these simulations. 
We use relativistic set of gyrokinetic equations (see _CITE_; _CITE_): _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the particle gyro-centre position, transversal drift velocity (_MATH_) and longitudinal velocity (_MATH_), respectively; _MATH_ is the magnetic field direction vector, _MATH_ is the _MATH_ drift component; _MATH_ is the magnetic moment per mass unit _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the particle gyration velocity. 
The relativistic coefficients are defined as _MATH_ and _MATH_, where the absolute particle velocity is _MATH_.
So we cannot directly use SWT and TILT algorithm. 
The main reason is, the TILT algorithm can only rectify already detected low-rank text regions and the SWT based detection is not effective unless the texts are already somewhat rectified. 
To resolve this dilemma and combine the strengths of both methods, we propose a simple yet effective scheme that integrates these two methods and can automatically extract almost all texts in an image despite their arbitrary initial deformations. 
Figure _REF_ shows the flowchart of the system and Figure _REF_ shows a typical result from our system. 
We have conducted extensive experiments (and comparisons with existing systems) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. 
As we will see from the experimental results, the rectification cannot only improve the detection accuracy considerably (see Table _REF_), but also improves the overall text recognition rates significantly (see Table _REF_).
The problem of optimal server placement is to decide which nodes are chosen from potential locations to deploy servers and how many servers to be deployed for each selected location. 
Most existing works focus on how to model server placement and how to achieve the solutions for corresponding model.
Measures of agreement are used in a wide range of behavioral, biomedical, psychosocial, and health-care related research to assess reliability of diagnostic test, psychometric properties of instrument, fidelity of psychosocial intervention, and accuracy of proxy outcome. 
The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) is a popular measure of agreement for continuous outcomes. 
In modern-day applications, data are often clustered, making inference difficult to perform using existing methods. 
In addition, as longitudinal study designs become increasingly popular, missing data has become a serious issue, and the lack of methods to systematically address this problem has hampered the progress of research in the aforementioned fields. 
In this paper, we develop a novel approach to tackle the complexities involved in addressing missing data and other related issues for performing CCC analysis within a longitudinal data setting. 
The approach is illustrated with both real and simulated data. 
The system (_REF_)-(_REF_) reflects the assumptions we make in the proofs of Lemmas _REF_ and _REF_. 
Namely, _MATH_ dynamics for _MATH_ are taken as deterministic, _MATH_ dynamics are taken as deterministic only after _MATH_ and _MATH_ dynamics are analyzed stochastically on all of _MATH_.
Spatial Pyramid _CITE_ is a hierarchical model based on encodings of spatially localized histograms, over increasingly large image regions. 
The bottom layer contains the finest grid, with higher layers containing coarser grids with bag of feature () encodings computed within each one. 
Originally, the descriptor was used to build a pyramid kernel as a linear combination of layered, histogram intersections kernels, but it can also be used stand-alone, in conjunction with linear predictors. 
It aligns well with the design of our 3D predictors, that can be either linear or kernel-based.
Note that _MATH_ can uniquely determine _MATH_, _MATH_, we denote the natural projects as _MATHDISP_. 
The projects can be determined precisely by Proposition _REF_. 
That is, denote by _MATH_, then we have _MATHDISP_.
Remark 5. 
In this research, fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate nonlinearities which include the unknown _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic systems, different values of the unknown _MATH_ and _MATH_ are choose in simulation. 
Figures 5,8 demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness against the parameter uncertainties in chaotic drive system.
Since for _MATH_ the solution _MATH_ is square-integrable, we may write the solution as _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, _MATH_ is in fact an ambit process, with the ambit set being the domain _MATH_. 
The reason for _MATH_ losing its square-integrability when going beyond dimension 3 lies in the fact that _MATH_ has a singularity at _MATH_ of order _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
By using ambit processes, we may define more general expressions _MATHDISP_, for general random fields _MATH_ sufficiently regular to make the stochastic integral well-defined. 
The set _MATH_ denotes some ambit set which can be defined to incorporate complex spatial dependency structures. 
In fact, such a specification _MATH_ may go beyond what can be linked to a stochastic partial differential equation, and still make sense as a random field (in particular, a real-valued random field).
Step 3: Differentiating _MATH_ results in the following differential equation. _MATHDISP_. 
Choose the Lyapunov function candidate as _MATH_. 
Furthermore, differentiating _MATH_ yields _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Then the control input_MATH_ is designed as _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_.
A popular algorithm for describing the electronic structure of localized system is based on a real space description. 
This algorithm solves the Kohn-Sham equation on a grid in real space _CITE_. 
This method was first tested against traditional solutions for silicon clusters and quantum dots. 
The real space approach has become popular and several groups have implemented different variations of this general approach_CITE_.
The two sunspots in AR 10930 have opposite polarities as shown in the upper panel of Figure _REF_. 
The rotating small sunspot of positive polarity is magnetically connected not only to the big sunspot of negative polarity, but also to the scattered poles of negative polarity located to its western side. 
As depicted in the lower panel of Figure _REF_, the connecting magnetic field lines appear to be highly sheared, which might be related to the rotational motion and eastward migration of the positive sunspot. 
The minor poles of negative polarity moved to the west while the positive sunspot moved eastward, implying that the sunspot was under emergence. 
The fact that this sunspot underwent rapid change while the larger sunspot of negative polarity did not, suggests that they may not represent a bipolar pair that has the same history of emergence and follows the Hale's polarity law. 
The larger sunspot of negative polarity had emerged earlier, before the active region appeared on the solar disk, as an _MATH_ configuration with weak twist, while the smaller sunspot of positive polarity emerged later as another _MATH_ configuration with strong twist. 
The close interaction between the two while the emergence of the latter not only resulted in the complex _MATH_ configuration as is observed, but also produced a series of X-class flares as early as 6 December when the active region appeared on the disk.
Case 2. 
If _MATH_, then _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It follows now from the previous lemma that: _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, _MATH_, we conclude that, for all _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
By duality it follows now that: _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Similarly, we have: _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_, _MATH_.
To determine the bulk viscous pressure one also has to calculate the expansion scalar, _MATH_. 
One possibility is to take the standard form, used in this work, using a second order accurate central difference formula, _MATH_. 
The other form can be expressed from the conservation of energy, _MATH_, or in case we also have conserved charge, from the continuity equation, _MATH_, leading to, _MATH_.
For the domain _MATHDISP_, from (_REF_) it immediately follows that _MATHDISP_ for small values of _MATH_. 
Consequently, _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_.
On the realization of multi-phase oscillators using fractional-order allpass filters
Our considerations up to now specified the limit of hadronic matter, defined as the point of disappearance of the vacuum as a large-scale feature. 
This point was determined through percolation studies, and the percolation limit is in general not a thermodynamic phase transition. 
Percolation can thus naturally provide a way to produce a rapid cross-over not associated with any singularity of the partition function _CITE_. 
It should be noted, however, that for spin systems, thermal critical behavior can be formulated in terms of percolation _CITE_. 
It seems possible to extend this to gauge systems, and first such studies relate the onset of deconfinement at _MATH_ to Polyakov loop percolation _CITE_, analogous to the onset of magnetisation as the percolation of spin clusters. 
Here it is the onset of large scale disorder, i.e., of the vacuum, which induces critical behavior. 
From the confined side, we thus have hadronic bag fusion leading to the disappearence of the physical vacuum, while on the deconfined side, formation of disordered clusters in an ordered medium correspond to the appearence of the vacuum. 
Based on the spin-gauge universality _CITE_, deconfinement as Polyakov loop percolation could occur as first (SU(3)) or second order (SU(2)) phase transition, corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of a global center _MATH_ or _MATH_ symmetry.
In our approach we combine the G-W mechanism with the exact Pomeron Green's function of Eq. (_REF_). 
First, we replace the bare Pomeron Green's function _MATH_ in Eq. (_REF_) by _MATH_ of Eq. (_REF_), and, obtain _MATHDISP_, with a profile function _MATH_ determined by Eq. (_REF_).
_MATH_ and _MATH_ are endomorphisms of _MATH_, that send _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively. 
We note that these two operators were already defined by Stanley _CITE_ but with a different perspective.
Let denote _MATH_ by _MATH_ and _MATH_ by _MATH_. 
We have the following by Proposition _REF_.
The xy-shift _MATH_ of the cross correlation reference image propagates in the same way _MATHDISP_.
Figure _REF_ shows the solution families of classes (B-ii), (B-iii) and (B-iv) as curves in the frequency-amplitude space. 
Profiles of examples of these solutions corresponding to the marked points in Fig. _REF_ appear in Figs. _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_. 
Note that the coupled vortex in Fig. _REF_ has been obtained via the above described homotopy continuation from a vortex of charge one with _MATH_. 
As the phase plots of _MATH_ and _MATH_ show, the resulting coupled vortex is also of charge one.
If we assume (A), (B) and replace (C1), (C2), (U0) with:
(C) For any _MATH_: _MATHDISP_, 
In what follows, we consider the bifurcation of non-trivial solutions of the nonlinear elliptic problem (_REF_) with the separable potential (_REF_) in the lowest band gap described by Lemma _REF_. 
Let _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and rewrite the nonlinear elliptic problem (_REF_) in the form _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Two classes of non-trivial solutions of the bifurcation problem (_REF_) are considered for small _MATH_: bounded _MATH_-periodic solutions (Sect. _REF_) and bounded decaying solutions (Sects. 
_REF_-_REF_).
The Kappa-loss-cone (KLC) distribution function obeys a power-law not only at the lower energies but also at the relativistic energies. 
A relativistic KLC distribution has been introduced by _CITE_ for an appropriate characterization of the energetic particles found in planetary magnetospheres and other plasmas, where mirror geometries occur, i.e. a pronounced high-energy tail and an anisotropy. 
The field-aligned whistler growing modes in space plasmas have been investigated by _CITE_ and _CITE_ applying relativistic treatments for relativistic Kappa or KLC distributions. 
The threshold conditions for the whistler instability in a Kappa distributed plasma have been derived by _CITE_. 
Numerical calculations were carried out for a direct comparison between a KLC distribution and the current Kappa distribution. 
The KLC was also adopted to model the observed spectra of solar energetic protons _CITE_. 
Recent studies _CITE_ have introduced a generalized relativistic Kappa distribution which incorporates either temperature anisotropy or both loss cone and temperature anisotropy.
From the Equation (_REF_), the successive approximations can be obtained _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_
Each cylinder _MATH_ that is narrow in _MATH_ either becomes wide in _MATH_, or continues to be narrow in that cell. 
Let _MATH_ be the set of the _MATH_-silhouette lines of the narrow cylinders within _MATH_ (that is, the locus of all the _MATH_-tangency points on the boundary of the cylinder). 
Applying similar arguments as above, a narrow cylinder _MATH_ within a prism-subcell _MATH_ of the decomposition must have a _MATH_-silhouette line _MATH_, whose projection on _MATH_ meets the projection of _MATH_ on that plane. 
We thus charge the crossing of _MATH_ and _MATH_ to that of the respective projections of _MATH_ and _MATH_, and conclude that the number of narrow cylinders within _MATH_ is at most _MATH_, by the cutting property. 
We have thus shown:
First, we compare PPAs under _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Under _MATH_, the data were simulated under the REC, ADD or DOM models. 
In all the comparisons, _MATH_. 
To compare PPAs, we first report the means among 10,000 replicates. 
Then we examine the percentage (Bayesian power) of the simulated PPAs greater than 0.20 under _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
Although the threshold 0.2 for PPA still implies that _MATH_ is more likely than _MATH_, it is 20 times _MATH_ after observing the data. 
With _MATH_, PPA &gt; 0.20 also corresponds to a BF of about 30, which is a typical threshold for very strong evidence in favor of _MATH_ (Kass and Raftery 1995). 
The results for the four combinations of priors for _MATH_ and log OR are reported in Table 1.
_AUTHOR_ Abstract: Nonuniform transmultiplexers can be used for interconversion of signals with different sampling rates between the time-division multiplexing format, and the frequency-division multiplexing format. 
Here, we review the polyphase representation and discuss the _MATH_ model-matching design of finite impulse response nonuniform transmultiplexers by semidefinite programming. 
Then, we study the alias-component matrices. 
It will be shown that the alias-component matrices of nonuniform transmultiplexers are generalizations of those of linear periodically time-varying systems. 
In particular, it is shown that the output at any given frequency is only dependent on the input at a finite set of frequencies.
The first method, Approximation _REF_, was found to work very well for ATM options in three different Levy models with and without jumps. 
By the results in Section _REF_, it is also possible to apply the same approach to more general models, provided that prices of options on quadratic variation can still be computed efficiently. 
Hence one objective for future research will be to test its numerical performance for stochastic volatility models with and without jumps. 
For affine stochastic volatility models (see for example _CITE_), a class which includes the Heston model, the SVJ and SVJJ models of _CITE_ and most time-change-based stochastic volatility models, the results of _CITE_ could be used as a starting point. 
Since our approximation method "freezes" the stochastic volatility at time zero, one would expect it to perform worse for stochastic volatility models. 
On the other hand, Sepp _CITE_ has obtained encouraging results for the Heston model with a similar method.
The spatial weight matrix, _MATH_, is often included into a model specification to the dependent variable, to the explanatory variables, or to the error term. 
For instance, a spatial lag model for the _MATH_ variable _MATH_, may take the form _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the _MATH_ explanatory variables and _MATH_ vector of error terms, respectively, and _MATH_ denotes the Kronecker product. 
A spatial error model may take the form, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ may be specified as in a spatial autoregressive form, _MATHDISP_, or a spatial moving average form, _MATHDISP_.
Once data are distributed, the scenario that we are considering consists of storing the _MATH_ vector on file in the proper order. 
We understand under proper order storing all the _MATH_ entries in their original order, that is _MATH_ for our example. 
Note that preserving the data structure avoids further off-line sorting operations.
The purpose of this article is to examine what alterations are required to our understanding of the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind, which were developed in the previous cycle, to account for the observed unusual behavior in the Cycle 23-24 solar minimum. 
The reduction in the heliospheric magnetic field strength could be due simply to an inaccurate estimate of the number of CMEs present in the heliosphere in previous solar minima _CITE_. 
We had assumed that in previous minima there would be little magnetic flux in the heliosphere due to CMEs, and the observed heliospheric magnetic field would be at the constant backgound level. 
If this were not correct, and there was still magnetic flux associated with CMEs present, then the actual backgound level of open magnetic flux is lower. 
Then, in the Cycle 23-24 solar minimum, with its lower level of activity, there may be fewer CMEs, and we are now approaching the backgound level. 
This explanation does not require any alterations in the basic concepts for the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field that have been developed, only a lower actual background level of open magnetic flux.
ICP is in essence a greedy algorithm, and will not always converge to the global optimum, but it has obtained popularity, because it gives good results, with decent data and initial guess.
RLOF process and CE evolution are very important in the formation of hot subdwarf stars and other binary systems. 
Earlier published studies of _CITE_ provided useful qualitative insights in RLOF and CE evolution, but left considerable room for improvement, especially with regard to the range of evolved phases that need to be addressed. 
These deficiencies were in part redressed in later work _CITE_, but only a fragment of that work was ever published _CITE_. 
The stellar adiabatic mass loss models described in this paper considerably extend the scope of Hjellming's work. 
They allow us not only to study the interior structure of donor stars undergoing dynamical time scale mass transfer, but also to evaluate the stability criteria for dynamical mass transfer in binary population synthesis.
The strategy _MATH_ is an ESS if and only if one of the following condition is met: 
[C1] 
_MATH_ and _MATH_,

_MATH_ and _MATH_.
By analogy with (_REF_), for an electron one can also introduce _MATH_- the distribution of radiated power as a function of the angle _MATH_. 
Then expression (_REF_) for radiated power _MATH_ for an electron takes the following form _MATHDISP_. 
For an electron, one can also introduce (by analogy with (_REF_)) the functions _MATH_, which determine the contribution of the _MATH_-polarization component to the angular distribution of radiation in the direction given by _MATH_, and a degree of radiation polarization for each fixed _MATH_. 
Taking into account (_REF_) and (_REF_) we find _MATHDISP_. 
Particular values of the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ could be found in Appendix (B).
The above model has no lagged correlation beyond lag one. 
Stock indices have more structures, with a small and regularly decaying short term correlation. 
The model can be easily extended by introducing an autoregressive structure in the return _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ i.i.d.(0, _MATH_. 
Then the autocovariance structure of the model becomes _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_. 
This lagged correlation replicates the empirical data for stock indices as shown in _CITE_, where a small incoherent effect at lag one is present.
As one of AIA's discoveries, QFP wave trains with typical speeds of 500 - _MATH_ are evidence of fast-mode magnetosonic waves in funnel-shaped waveguides from active regions. 
They are commonly associated with quasi-periodic flare pulsations (Section _REF_). 
Open questions on QFPs include:
the origin of periodicities, especially those not identified in flare pulsations with possible connections to three-minute sunspot and other (sub)surface oscillations;
 their roles in energy transport and coronal heating;
 the relation between QFPs within funnels and quasi-periodic wave trains within EIT waves ahead of CME flanks.
Now, from condition (H2), we know that there exist _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_. 
From (H3), we have that _MATHDISP_. 
So _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_, accordingly, we have _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the nonnegative eigenfunctions of _MATH_ corresponding to _MATH_, and _MATH_, respectively. 
Then we have from the (3.1) that _MATHDISP_. 
Letting _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, we obtain that _MATHDISP_, and consequently _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, we deduce from (3.2) that _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, _MATH_. 
This contradicts _MATH_. 
The times separating two characteristic periods (AM and DM) are important intervals of the solar magnetic cycle. 
The time between solar maximum and the beginning of the declining phase coincides with the inversion of Sun's global magnetic field. On the other hand, the time between the solar minimum and the ascending phase is related to the start of the new solar cycle and the change of the magnetic polarity of sunspots according to Hale's law.
These features of the magnetic-flux imbalance can explain the North-South asymmetry of the magnetic flux and its change in the course of 11-year solar cycle. 
North-South asymmetry of the magnetic flux displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere for Solar Cycles _MATH_ (see Figure _REF_ and Table _REF_). 
In the ascending phase (from the solar-activity minimum to the reversal) the northern hemisphere always dominates. 
During the reversal the dominant role passes to the southern hemisphere which prevails until the next minimum. 
Near the solar-activity minimum the northern hemisphere becomes dominant again. 
Data considered in our analysis (_MATH_) refer to the four Schwabe Cycles (_MATH_), when activity of the northern hemisphere was leading in time (see Introduction). 
The regular change of the North-South asymmetry of magnetic flux observed by us is in agreement with this effect.
(2) Test modules do not behave well under localization. 
Let _MATH_ be a 2-dimensional local hypersurface such that _MATH_ is not regular for some _MATH_ (e.g. _MATH_ and _MATH_). 
Let _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ by Corollary _REF_(i). 
However, _MATH_ is free over _MATH_ and hence _MATH_.
Nota Bene: many of the above integrals for bounds [0,1] were already treated by different authors. 
However, none of them noticed that they can be equally taken from 1 to _MATH_ and that they all obey _MATH_. 
In particular, result a), in a slightly different form, as well as result b) were presented by Adamchik _CITE_ (it should be, however, noted that both integrals may be easily obtained from Malmsten's integrals _REF_ and _REF_ respectively by means of a simple change of variable). 
Result c) is a particular case of the Malmsten's integral _REF_ for _MATH_ (see also exercise n¬∞_REF_ below), and it was also independently evaluated in _CITE_. 
Integral h) for real _MATH_ was evaluated by Malmsten _CITE_ and also appears in _CITE_, in _CITE_ and in _CITE_ (see also exercise n¬∞_REF_ above). 
Integrals d) and e) are particular cases of h) with _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively. 
Integrals f) and g) may be deduced from integrals d) and e) respectively by making a suitable change of variable; integral g) was also independently evaluated in _CITE_ (authors, however, did not simplified their result). 
By the way, formula h) may provide many other useful results. 
For instance, result given in the Proposition 7.5 _CITE_ may be directly obtained from h) by differentiating it with respect to _MATH_; formul√¶ obtained in examples 7.8-7.10 _CITE_ follows immediately from such a derivative.
For our further arguments we would rather like to have global solutions, i.e., on the whole interval _MATH_. 
To obtain these, we impose slightly more restrictive conditions. 
More precisely, we suppose the condition that for every _MATH_, there exist constants _MATH_ such that for every _MATH_ and for every _MATH_ holds _MATHDISP_, where the optimal constants _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_. 
We say a continuous function _MATH_ belongs to the class _MATH_, if _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
The subclass _MATH_ consists of all functions _MATH_ which additionally fulfill _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ equipped with the increasing family of norms _MATH_ becomes a complete locally convex vector space. 
Our main assumption then reads as _MATH_ for all _MATH_, i.e., for _MATH_ holds _MATHDISP_. 
In order to prove results which are independent of the number of terms in the affine expansion _REF_, we shall further require summability of the coefficient sequence _MATH_. 
Specifically, we assume the sequence of Lipschitz constants to be summable, i.e., _MATHDISP_. 
Under this assumption, the sum in _REF_ converges uniformly with respect to _MATH_ and for all _MATH_. 
Let the conditions _REF_ and _REF_ be satisfied. 
Then the sum in _REF_ converges absolutely and uniformly in _MATH_ as a _MATH_-valued mapping, and it holds _MATH_. 
We fix _MATH_ and denote by _MATH_ the _MATH_-term partial sum of _REF_. 
Then we estimate with _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and with the assumptions _REF_ and _REF_ and the triangle inequality _MATHDISP_ as _MATH_, since by assumption _REF_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
This shows that the expression _REF_ is well-defined for every _MATH_ and for every _MATH_. 
Moreover, the assumption _REF_ for all _MATH_ implies that _MATH_ satisfies a Lipschitz condition uniform in _MATH_: for every _MATH_ holds _MATHDISP_, where the Lipschitz constant _MATHDISP_ is finite by _REF_. 
This proves the asserted uniform Lipschitz condition for the infinite sum _REF_ in _MATH_.
Kerr increment of refractive index in air _MATH_ is determined by electronic nonlinearity and induced Raman scattering on rotational transitions of air molecules, which lead to delayed nonlinear response _CITE_. 
Response time of Raman scattering in air is about 70 fs _CITE_ and it should be taken into account for pulses of femtosecond duration. 
According to _CITE_ for increment _MATH_ in air following approximation is valid: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ - response function; _MATH_ - field intensity; _MATH_ - nonlinear coefficient of air. 
For air and wavelength 800 nm we used nonlinear coefficient equal to _MATH_ cm_MATH_/W, which corresponds to self-focusing critical power of 2.4 GW.
In view of Proposition _REF_ and its analogy for q.p. sequences mentioned in the foregoing section, a discrete (i.e. restricted to _MATH_) analogy of Theorem _REF_ holds for sequences.
We have developed several multi-path reservation algorithms for in-advance scheduling of single and multiple file transfers in connection-oriented optical networks. 
A novel two-step solution, All-Batch, has been developed to compute schedules with minimum finish time (i.e., optimal schedules). 
An N-Batch heuristic was developed to enable batch scheduling in more realistic scenarios. 
We also proposed a new max-flow based greedy algorithm (GOS) and four variants of k-path algorithms to reduce computation time. 
These heuristics schedule an individual file transfer to complete at the earliest possible time.
When decreasing _MATH_ beyond _MATH_, we find a strong dependence on _MATH_ and even more puzzling a fast saturation of _MATH_. 
The fact that the spectral functions tend towards a sum of peaked functions should be considered a generic feature of method and not be over-interpreted. 
The agreement at _MATH_ with the two-pole ansatz is probably a coincidence, in particular since the true spectral function is expected to have a finite width.
From Figure 9 we also find that the daily averages of the mean densities of _MATH_ are always higher than those of _MATH_. 
However, the daily averages of the mean densities of _MATH_ are NOT higher than those of _MATH_, as is shown in Figure 10. 
So this result is not a natural consequence of the daily averages of the mean densities of _MATH_ and _MATH_.
The dynamics of coupled nonlinear oscillators has received much attention over the last years, we study two van der Pol oscillators with linear coupling _MATHDISP_. 
This model is suggested in _CITE_ as the microwave model where _MATH_. 
Also, this model is considered as the SA-AV nodes in heart which its synchronization is investigated in _CITE_ by the describing function method. 
The advantage of consideration of this example is existence (nonexistence) of the bifurcations. 
Now, we rewrite this model as follows _MATHDISP_. 
From comparing the system (_REF_) with the system (_REF_), it is easy to see that functions _MATH_ are odd and _MATHDISP_. 
By the results of the section 4.1, the transcritical and pitchfork bifurcations do not occur in this model.
In Fig. _REF_ we present a comparison of our results for the longitudinal structure function _MATH_ with the available data at small-_MATH_ and for different _MATH_ bins. 
The theoretical results were obtained using the dipole parametrizations corresponding to fits (e) and (a) in Tables I and II respectively, although we have checked that all the others provide comparisons of similar quality with data. 
The agreement with data is good, provided the relatively large error bars in experimental data.
This has since been known as the coordination paradox. 
It refers to reconcilling individual level behaviour, which generally seems chaotic and without any higher-level collective goal, with that of the societal level, which is characterised by the generation of highly organised structures indicating that either some collective plan is carried out, or that some superior entity is responsible for centrally organising the individual activities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. 
In section 2 we give some preliminary results about super-Brownian motion. 
The main results and the corresponding proofs are presented in section 3. 
However, in order to facilitate the understanding of readers, we first give some of the basic results, which lead to our main theorems. 
In section 4 we will give an example to show that the main results also hold for some sub-domains in _MATH_.
One can solve the DGLAP equation (_REF_) by introducing the moments of the photon PDFs _CITE_. 
Here we discuss the procedure briefly. 
By taking the moment, one obtains the equation _MATHDISP_, where an _MATH_-th moment _MATH_ of a function _MATH_ is defined by _MATHDISP_. 
Then we introduce the variable _MATH_ as _CITE_ _MATHDISP_, instead of _MATH_. 
We expand _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ in powers of the QED coupling constant _MATH_ as well as the QCD coupling constant _MATH_ as follows _MATHDISP_, where the _MATH_ dependence appears in _MATH_ implicitly with the notation _CITE_, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ correspond to the LO and NLO solutions, respectively. 
One finally obtains the LO solution _MATH_ for the DGLAP equation (_REF_) as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the ratio of QCD couplings which is defined by _MATHDISP_.
We wish to control the extracellular concentrations of permeating and non-permeating solutes (_MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively) such that cells are equilibrated at a goal state in the shortest time while remaining within predefined state-constraints. 
For analytical simplicity we will use the solute-solvent transmembrane flux model described by Jacobs _CITE_ and commmonly used in cryobiology _CITE_. 
This model recently was noted to encompass a very large array of membrane transport phenomena _CITE_. 
After simplifying the osmotic pressure to a single term in a virial expansion and non-dimensionalizing (cf. _CITE_) we have the system _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the intracellular water volume and moles of solute, respectively, _MATH_ is the (assumed fixed) moles of nonpermeating solute, _MATH_ is a unitless relative permeability constant, and _MATH_ is a dimensionless temporal variable. 
Following an approach we have previously described _CITE_, we factor out _MATH_ to facilitate a time-transform with _MATHDISP_, resulting in a system that is linear in the concentration and state variables (see Table _REF_ for parameter definitions): _MATHDISP_, or _MATH_, for _MATH_, where _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_.
In analyzing mathematical problems in physics, one often finds it desirable to know the behavior of a function for large values of some parameter _MATH_, that is, the asymptotic behavior of the function. 
Specific examples are furnished by the well-known Gamma function and various Bessel functions _CITE_. 
All these analytic functions are defined by integrals _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is analytic in _MATH_ and depends on a real parameter _MATH_. 
In the most cases of physical interest the integrals like _MATH_ can be redefined in terms of _MATHDISP_ which leads to the explicit resolution of _MATH_, for large values of _MATH_, by an asymptotic approximation procedure named steepest descent method (SDM). 
The key idea in this method is that as _MATH_ grows very large, the main contribution to the integral will come from values of _MATH_ very close to the points at which _MATH_. 
Irrespective of the nature of the particular function, for some paths of integration along which the imaginary part of _MATH_ is constant, these points are called saddle-points because they are the points where the real and imaginary parts of _MATH_ are stationary with respect to the position in the complex plane _MATH_ without being an absolute maximum or minimum. 
In fact, if we have _MATH_, we can easily show from Cauchy-Riemann relations that along any path _MATH_ the rate of change of _MATH_ can only vanish at a saddle-point _CITE_. 
From any point, the direction in which _MATH_ decreases most rapidly is one along which _MATH_ is constant, and in this sense such paths are paths of steepest descent. 
Perhaps the commonest situation where the SDM is applicable is that in which the path of integration _MATH_ runs from a saddle-point _MATH_ to infinite, with _MATH_ decreasing monotonically all the way. 
In a simplified analysis, the function _MATH_ can be expanded around _MATH_ into a Taylor expansion. 
If we replace _MATH_ with the first two terms of this expansion in the exponential of Eq. (_REF_), _MATHDISP_, with _MATHDISP_, and extend the limits of integration from _MATH_ to _MATH_, we find _MATHDISP_ 
In extensions of this method complex analysis is used to find a contour of steepest descent for an equivalent integral expressed as a path integral. 
To get the first term in the asymptotic expansion of (_REF_) the value of _MATH_ at _MATH_ is required. 
Provided _MATH_ is not zero and _MATH_ is not infinite the integral _MATH_ results _MATHDISP_ which, however, is not completely free of some particular supplementary conditions for its applicability _CITE_. 
An alternative, and very similar, method to the SDM is the stationary phase method (SPM). 
Though perhaps less general and less immediately convincing analytically, it often has the advantage of closer contact with the physical problem. 
The integral to be considered is more suitably written as _MATHDISP_ where, in practice, the exponential commonly represents a traveling wave. 
The SPM was first introduced explicitly by Lord Kelvin _CITE_. 
A rigorous mathematical treatment which would justify the statements made above was subsequently done by Watson _CITE_ and the complete discussion involving the asymptotic approximation was done by Focke _CITE_. 
The deductions from the SPM follow much the same pattern as those from the SDM. 
The assumed paths of integration are _MATH_, which means that the amplitude part of the exponential is constant along the path, while the phase part varies most rapidly, a reversal of the situation in the SDM. 
For asymptotic values of _MATH_ the rapid oscillations of _MATH_ over most of the range of integration means that the integrand averages to almost zero. 
Exceptions to this cancellation rule occur only when the stationary phase condition is satisfied, i.e. the only significant contribution to the integral arises from portions of the path in the vicinity of saddle-points or end-points, but the physical interpretation of the mechanism by which this comes about is now in terms of phase interference rather than amplitude decay. 
Thus the approximation corresponding to (_REF_) for the SDM is _MATHDISP_ for the SPM. 
But one aspect in which there is some distinction between the methods should be noted. 
With a steepest descent path which starts at a saddle-point and does not go to infinity, the contribution of the point at the end of the path to the strict asymptotic expansion is zero in comparison with the saddle-point contribution by the virtue of the extra exponential factor it contains. 
On the other hand, with a stationary phase path of the same type the contribution of the point at the end of the path is, in general, of the order of that of the saddle-point merely divided by _MATH_; it is excluded, therefore, from the asymptotic approximation only if the first term of the asymptotic expansion is alone retained. 
To sum up, the methods of steepest descent and stationary phase, strip off their mathematical expression, depend on choosing a path of integration in such a way that the integrand, due to its exponential factor, contributes irrelevantly to the integral except in the vicinity of certain saddle-points (or end-points).
This section provides a detailed guide for detecting line segments, and an outline for detecting circles.
The transient responses of the closed-loop uncertain system to unit step inputs are shown in Figure _REF_. 
Clearly, the mutual interaction between two channels is very small (i.e., the channels are decoupled), which is due to the closeness of both singular values of _MATH_ to the desired frequency response _MATH_ which is a diagonal matrix.
Consider the operator _MATH_ defined by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are solutions of problems _MATH_, _MATH_, respectively. 
It is clear to see the following:
The data presented in this paper correspond closely with e.g. the data from spectroscopic measurements from SOHO/SUMER that showed that at the heights of 1.05 - 1.35 solar radii the plume velocities are in excess of 60 km s_MATH_ and are approximately constant throughout this height range _CITE_.
Condition 1 means that the ''net''growth rate of AD cells and the ''natural net''growth rate of AI cells are both equal to zero, under which the tumor relapse cannot be avoided due to the mutation of AD cells (_MATH_) that results in an increase of AI cells, as shown in (4.10); however, (4.10) also clearly suggests that controlling the mutation (i.e. increasing the value of _MATH_) may delay (for _MATH_) or prevent (for _MATH_) the relapse. 
In fact, by (4.10), as _MATH_, _MATHDISP_.
We propose a method for approximating the distance matrix for data sets of bit vectors. 
The core idea is to randomly choose _MATH_ _MATH_-dimensional subspaces and consider a bucket for each possible bit vector in this subspace. 
Then, the vectors are hashed into the matching buckets and, for each pair of tuples the occurrences in the same bucket are counted. 
The exact Hamming distance is approximated based on the portion of co-occurrences in the _MATH_ subspaces. 
Next, we parallelize the computation using two schemes. 
The first assigns each subspace to a single processor calculating its parts of the co-occurrence matrix and afterwards adds up the complete co-occurrence matrix over all subspaces. 
The second method exchanges results between each processor during computation.
Rules, as defined, recommend that all agents be located at the same side of their peaks. 
That is, _MATH_ if _MATH_, and _MATH_ otherwise.
We find explicit solutions _MATH_ and _MATH_ for the shape of the spiralling string by minimizing the Nambu-Goto action _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_ is the induced metric on the worldsheet and _MATH_ is the spacetime metric (_REF_). 
We shall find it convenient to describe the shape of the string with the dimensionless variables _MATHDISP_, and specify the motion of the quark with the dimensionless parameters _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATHDISP_ and note that the dimensionless acceleration of the quark at _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_. 
The Lagrangian now takes the form _MATHDISP_. 
Here, the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the dimensionless bulk variable _MATH_, e.g. _MATH_. 
We then obtain the equations of motion _MATHDISP_ from the Lagrangian (_REF_). 
These are the equations that determine _MATH_ and _MATH_ and hence the shape of the spiralling string trailing below the rotating quark.
An example image analysed according to the procedures outlined in the previous sections is shown in Fig. _REF_(II) which gives an impression of the full field of view. 
The area highlighted by the rectangle in the image is shown magnified in Fig. _REF_(I) demonstrating the high spatial resolution achieved by the method.
By definition, we say that _MATH_ is amenable if _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ is finitely generated, then it suffices to check (_REF_) for one finite symmetric generating set _MATH_. 
In this case, _MATH_ is the set of all _MATH_ for which there exists a _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are connected by an edge in the Cayley graph _MATH_. 
Thus, we may describe (_REF_) by saying that it is possible to find nonempty sets _MATH_ whose surface is small compared to their volume. 
For example, _MATH_ is amenable, but regular trees are not.
Define _MATHDISP_, as a straightforward consequence of (1.7), we have _MATHDISP_, note that _MATH_ is of the order _MATH_ as _MATH_.
After Solar Cycle 24 peaks and activity begins to subside a new set of predictions for Solar Cycle 25 will appear. 
At some point one or more groups will convene to develop a consensus prediction for Solar Cycle 25. 
Here is a list of topics and questions for the creators of those predictions to consider:
An obfuscator _MATH_ satisfies the _CITE_-approximate functionality requirement for a family of functions _MATH_ iff there exists a negligible function _MATH_ such that for all _MATH_ and all _MATH_ _MATHDISP_.
We assume now that _MATH_ (with the possible value 0 for _MATH_, in which case _MATH_). 
This ensures that _MATH_. 
Thanks to the ordering of the subscripts, we have _MATHDISP_. 
If we replace the classes _MATH_ by a unique virtual class with weight _MATH_ and we asume this virtual class is always claiming its full share of the service rate. 
The service rate received by this virtual class is clearly an upper bound for the sum of the service rates received by the classes _MATH_. 
Note that the system with this virtual class is the same as the one described above. 
Hence this virtual class receives mean service rate _MATH_ and we have for any finite workload process _MATH_ defined on _MATH_ (we denote _MATH_), _MATHDISP_. 
In particular, we have _MATHDISP_.
With the aid of the first-order condition for _MATH_ (_REF_), the distributional characteristic _MATH_ of labor income is defined as (minus) the normalized covariance between the social marginal utility of income _MATH_, and gross labor income _MATH_ _CITE_: _MATHDISP_, where the second equality follows from (_REF_). 
With a positive distributional characteristic _MATH_, taxing labor income yields distributional benefits, because the high-ability worker has a lower welfare weight than the low-ability worker, i.e. _MATH_, and earns a higher income, _MATH_. 
Indeed, a zero distributional characteristic implies either that the government is utilitarian (_MATH_), and not interested in redistribution, or that the marginal contribution to the tax base is equal for both ability types (i.e., taxable income _MATH_ is the same for both types).
At the top trimline, the blending boundary constraints for this blending task are _MATHDISP_ 
At the bottom trimline, the blending boundary constraints become _MATHDISP_
_REF_ depicts our results, which show that all six notions of _MATH_-_MATH_-security for KEMs are equivalent. 
The equivalences of the right-hand-side of _REF_ are a consequence. 
The trivial implications (dashed arrows) of _REF_ should be clear from the definitions. 
We now prove the two other implications.
Stopping condition: 
If the maximum number of iterations is not reached, go back to step 2. 
Otherwise, END: the best solution found is _MATH_.
The phenomenological Green's function developed in the works of Yang, Rice and Zhang has been very successful in understanding many of the anomalous superconducting properties of the deeply underdoped cuprates. 
It is based on considerations of the resonating valence bond spin liquid approximation and is designed to describe the underdoped regime of the cuprates. 
Here we emphasize the region of doping, _MATH_, just below the quantum critical point at which the pseudogap develops. 
In addition to Luttinger hole pockets centered around the nodal direction, there are electron pockets near the antinodes which are connected to the hole pockets by gapped bridging contours. 
We determine the contours of nearest approach as would be measured in angular resolved photoemission experiments and emphasize signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction from the large Fermi contour of Fermi liquid theory (which contains _MATH_ hole states) to the Luttinger pocket (which contains _MATH_ hole states). 
We find that the quasiparticle effective mass renormalization increases strongly towards the edge of the Luttinger pockets beyond which it diverges.
Define _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It is obvious from definition (3.3) that _MATHDISP_. 
Now, applying (C5) and noting (3.25), we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
This shows that the operator _MATH_ maps _MATH_ into _MATH_. 
Moreover, the operator _MATH_ is continuous and completely continuous. 
Schauder's fixed point theorem guarantees that _MATH_ has a fixed point in _MATH_, which is a positive solution of (3.5). 
Hence, _MATH_ is an eigenvalue of (3.5), i.e., _MATH_. 
The aim of our research in this chapter is to study the asymptotic behavior of this OCP as _MATH_; that is, when the number of attached thin cylinders infinitely increases and their thickness vanishes. 
The approach we propose gives the possibility of replacing the original OCP by some limit problem defined in a more simple domain. 
We show that an optimal control for the limit problem can be taken as a prototype for the modeling of suboptimal controls to the original one. 
It should be stressed here that if the small parameter _MATH_ is changed, then all components of this control problems (the domain _MATH_, the constraint sets _MATH_ and _MATH_, the cost functional _MATH_, and the set, where we seek its infimum) are changed as well. 
Let us observe also that the volume of the material included in the set _MATH_- does not converge to 0 as _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_- in the Hausdorff metric and _MATH_; that is, the set _MATH_- is filled up by the thin cylinders in the limit passage as _MATH_. 
It produces the fact that the Neumann boundary controls _MATH_ will transform (as _MATH_ to some distributed control function _MATH_ on the right-hand side of the homogenized equation.
Let us ultimately insist on the fact that the expression in the right hand side _MATH_ is a function of _MATH_ due to the action of the shift and is therefore a different function than _MATH_. 
Only the expectations of both expressions of Eq. (_REF_) are equal.
To estimate the norm of _MATH_, we apply the operator _MATH_ to both sides of the first equation of system (_REF_) to obtain the equation _MATHDISP_. 
Applying _MATH_ to both sides of Eq.(_REF_) for _MATH_ gives rise to _MATHDISP_. 
For the right-hand of Eq.(_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATHDISP_, using Lemma 4.1, _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Lemma 4.1 yields _MATHDISP_.
From (_REF_) we see that the one loop field strength induced by (_REF_) obeys the equation, _MATHDISP_. 
The retarded solution (_REF_) takes the form, _MATHDISP_, where, _MATHDISP_. 
We can commute the differential operator in (_REF_) through the Greens function to define a scalar function _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
In terms of _MATH_ the electric and magnetic field strengths are, _MATHDISP_.
By defining a function _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_, we have the following theorem: 
The function _MATH_ defined by (_REF_) is differentiable and uniformly approximate to function _MATH_ on the whole space _MATH_.
Another type of radio burst which has been associated with the magnetic reconnection in solar flares is the short (_MATH_ 0.1 second), narrowband (some MHz) emissions known as "spikes". 
They appear in broadband clusters lasting seconds to about a minute. 
Metric spikes at 250-500 MHz are quite common near the starting frequency of metric Type III bursts and are thus linked with the acceleration of electron beams _CITE_. 
They are considered as the signatures of accelerated particles at a highly fragmented, primary energy release site _CITE_. 
At the same time they pinpoint the location of the reconnection and acceleration site.
Figure _REF_ shows the fitting results in Bode diagram of the three approximation methods, where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are the rational approximate transfer functions designed by the adaptive chaotic PSO, linear PSO and CFE methods.
Step 2: Solve the equations (_REF_) and (_REF_) jointly to obtain the updated estimates _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Once the resources have been successfully allocated, the network CTE updates the NRDL description accordingly, as shown in Fig. _REF_, where the "answer" field shows the "Allowed" value for both bandwidth and secure channel requirements. 
Finally, the network CTE forwards the modified INVITE message to the receiver, leading to the typical SIP conclusion of the session initiation phase (packets no. 13 to 17).
Events like the ones described in this work are found in the region between the two main magnetic polarities, in the vicinity of the polarity inversion line, where the newer flux is in emergence. 
Events are not ubiquitously distributed in the active region though. 
Emerging SAFSs are part of serpentine-type fields that are re-arranged by reconnection to form the large-scale field of the active region. 
Brightenings produced by the interaction/reconnection of fields are hereby preferably located in these regions where emerging loops are more likely to interact with ambient fields, and thus mainly detected in the region between the two main magnetic polarities.
For all _MATH_, with _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, and for all _MATH_, with _MATH_, _MATHDISP_ Thus _MATH_ and _MATH_ in Theorem _REF_ hold true. 
We finally prove that _MATH_ in Theorem _REF_ holds.
In this section, we do robust stability analysis of the uncertain impulsive system (_REF_) with time delay. 
We shall need the following corollary. 
Assume there exist positive definite matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_ for each _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_; _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Then the trivial solution of system (_REF_) with _MATH_ is asymptotically stable for any time-delay _MATH_ satisfying _MATH_. 
For any _MATH_, and _MATH_, inequality (_REF_) can be rewritten as _MATHDISP_. with _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
Modified gravity must be stable at the classical and quantum level. 
There are in principle several kinds of instabilities to consider, such as Dolgov-Kawasaki criterion in f(R) gravity _CITE_. 
Below, following Ref. _CITE_, we will focus on the stability criterion at de Sitter point in the modified f(G) gravity.
In our second scenario, we tested the libraries on an Intel Core2 CPU 6700 2.66 GHz and 2 GB of RAM running Linux. 
All source code was compiled with gcc 4.3 and optimization setting -O3. 
Both algorithms that we included in our benchmark, IST as well as VPS (see Section _REF_), work independent of the object's complexity. 
Therefore, we chose the objects in their highest resolution to compute required data structures, the sphere packing and the voxmap and pointshell, respectively. 
The running-time of VPS scales linearly with the size of the pointshell. 
However, the limiting factor of the VPS is actually the high memory consumption of the voxmap. 
For our measurements, we included the highest resolution for the voxmap that just fits into the main memory. 
The running-time of the IST algorithms depends mainly on the number of inner spheres. 
Therefore, we included different sphere packing resolutions in our measurements.
Another thing to note is that the Tax Credits- and the IS-partnership net bonuses tend to be strongly negatively correlated. 
Consider again the four families used above. 
The two families that face Tax Credit bonuses, i.e. family 1 and 3, will also face (even larger) IS partnership penalties. 
Conversely, the two families that face Tax Credit partnership penalties, i.e. family 2 and 4, face no IS penalties since the female is also working.
Compared to the problem _REF_, there is no zeroth order terms involving self-interactions in this problem. 
This does not affect the regularity issues of solutions. 
The free boundary problem in the singular limit as _MATH_ of _REF_ is _MATHDISP_. 
Here the free boundary is _MATHDISP_. 
The last condition in _REF_ implies that for different _MATH_, the supports of _MATH_ are disjoint. 
Note that _MATH_ depends on the solution _MATH_ and can not be prescribed, hence the name "free boundaries".
As shown in the previous section, expectations about future net income influence the university enrollment decision. 
Therefore the estimated structural model can be applied to simulate the effects of tax policy scenarios on university enrollment. 
As an illustrative example, we analyze the effects of two revenue-neutral flat-rate tax scenarios. 
Flat-rate taxes have been widely discussed in Germany; _CITE_, _CITE_, and the Council of Economic Advisors to the Ministry of Finance _CITE_ all have presented proposals for tax policy reforms with (almost) flat-rate schedules.
Proof. 
We adopt the method used in Chow _CITE_. 
Let _MATH_ be an independent copy of the Poisson random measure _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
For any _MATH_ and _MATH_, define _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ be the compensated Poisson random measure of _MATH_. 
For each _MATH_, consider the system: _MATHDISP_. 
By virtue of Theorem 3.3, there exists a unique solution _MATH_ for each _MATH_, provided _MATH_. 
Therefore, from the Gronwall Lemma, it follows that for some positive constants _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_, define _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATH_ fulfills that _MATHDISP_, where for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
Then from Lemma 4.3, it follows that there exist positive _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Thanks to (4.10), there exists a positive constant _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Then by virtue of (4.13), one gets, _MATHDISP_. 
This implies that _MATH_ is Cauchy in _MATH_. 
As a consequence, there exists a unique random vector _MATH_ such that _MATH_, as _MATH_ in _MATH_ sense. 
We remark that the vector processes _MATHDISP_ admit the same distribution on the same probability space for each _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be the induced probability measure of _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is the unique invariant measure for the transient semigroup _MATH_. 
Thus the proof of the theorem is finished. 
Let us introduce the following Hilbert spaces _MATH_, where _MATH_, with the norm _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
For every _MATH_ and every _MATH_, there exists _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ 
It is sufficient to assume that _MATH_ (using complex interpolation). 
For _MATH_ we know that _MATH_ is unitary. 
Let us denote _MATH_. 
Let us assume _MATH_. 
It is enough to prove that _MATH_ is bounded from _MATH_ into _MATH_.
The case of weak gross substitutes is analyzed next. 
Let us first restrict the space of tax rates:
The BBM equation is a well-known model for long waves in shallow water which was introduced by Benjamin, Bona, and Mahony (_CITE_, 1972) as an improvement of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV equation) for modeling long waves of small amplitude in two dimensions. 
Contrasting with the KdV equation, the BBM equation is unstable in high wavenumber components. 
Further, while the KdV equation has an infinite number of integrals of motion, the BBM equation only has three. 
More results for the wellposedness and infinite dimensional dynamical systems for BBM equations, we can refer _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_.
For any graph _MATH_ with _MATH_, and any _MATH_, we have _MATH_.
Another facet of working memory, important to the study of its impairment in SZ, is the change in the regularity of its neural representation over time as the task progresses. 
To study this progression, the 14 probe events in Probe epoch of the tasks were divided into three sets of 5, 5 and 4 events each. 
The effect of this task phase on prediction accuracy (averaged over three runs consisting of six presentation blocks each) is graphed in Figure _REF_.
In order to simplify the writings, in the sequel _MATH_ denotes a generic nonnegative constant. 
So, it may take different value at each occurrence.
Additionally, we wanted to compare those two workloads using the _MATH_ on-line strategy at the grid-level and FCFS in local queues for the increasing number of AR tasks. 
Table _REF_ shows obtained results in the light of defined three criteria: _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Significant differences between those workloads can be related to their characteristics. 
Among tasks with lower IDs, most of them require only 1 processor, while in the second set the mode value for this attribute is 64. 
Further analysis showed another interesitng dependence. 
It turned out that workoad 1-1000 contains about 15% of tasks that use 64 processor but their runtime and requested time are 349 and 2041 seconds respectively. 
On the other hand, in workload 68000-69000 there is almost 17% of processor intensive tasks with mean runtime equal to 19342 seconds and requested time equal to 37279 seconds. 
Seeing that impact of AR-tasks on these criteria is more visible for jobs with IDs from 68000 to 69000, we decided to used for the rest of our experiments the second set of tasks taken from the SDSC SP2 workload with the same two-level hierarchical structure.
Turning now to genealogies, we have described the coalescence of lineages caused by the whole period of HIV escape. 
However, as mentioned, we can decompose HIV escape into time intervals _MATH_. 
Each such period corresponds to a _MATH_ or _MATH_ partition and so we know the distribution of the lineages at each _MATH_ given the lineage state at _MATH_. 
Between the _MATH_, however, our results do not describe the lineages. 
Figures _REF_ and _REF_ show genealogies formed for a 5 epitope and 2 epitope attack, respectively, in the case of a linear escape graph under the SPR. 
Here we have shown all coalescent events that happen during _MATH_ to occur at _MATH_. 
Both genealogy figures were produced using Figtree. 
(Figtree is available as part of the BEAST software package _CITE_.)
The strategy for obtaining the best model was developed in Article I and is as follows: We assumed the simplest vertical-flow model that reduces to a _MATH_ vertical flow at the surface and still approaches the _MATH_ seconds for the asymptotic behavior of the _MATH_ signal at large _MATH_. 
This is the gaussian with a single peak. 
For a particular choice of depth of the peak vertical flow _MATH_, the width of the gaussian and its amplitude are determined uniquely by the _MATH_ seconds _MATH_ signal requirement and the _MATH_ upward flow at the photosphere. 
With some reasonable choices for the horizontal parameters _MATH_ and _MATH_ (see Article I), the horizontal flow is then determined from the vertical flow and the continuity equation. 
Three models were examined that bracket the observations. 
These are distinguished by the height of the peak flow, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
The _MATH_ signal is computed from the ray theory using both the vertical and horizontal flow components. 
We found that the _MATH_ model was most similar to the observations. 
For the _MATH_ model (and any with a deeper _MATH_), the horizontal component contributes significantly and leads to a behavior at large separations that is inconsistent with the observations. 
We conclude that if there is a deeper horizontal flow, it must have a small magnitude to not be observed in the _MATH_ signal.
This image coincides closely with three white-light flare kernels that appear in the sunspot penumbra. 
The close spatial correspondence between white-light and acoustic emission encouraged the authors to assume that the acoustic emission is driven by heating of the lower photosphere. 
The authors suggested that in the case where the direct heating of the low photosphere by protons or high-energy electrons is unrealistic, the strong association between the acoustic source and cospatial continuum emission can be regarded as evidence supporting the back-warming hypothesis, in which the low photosphere is heated by the radiation from the overlying chromosphere.
The decay of electron spin coherence by the hyperfine interaction with the _MATH_C nuclear spins can be refocused by the usual spin-echo experiments. 
As shown in Fig. _REF_, a single refocusing pulse, corresponding to the Hahn echo, can generate echoes for delays of up to 10 _MATH_s. 
For longer times, the refocusing does not work, because fluctuations in the environment make the refocusing inefficient. 
Like in the case of molecular diffusion, it becomes then necessary to apply multiple refocusing pulses with shorter delays between them _CITE_. 
As shown by the other curves in Fig. _REF_, sequences of refocusing pulses can extend the coherence time up to about 1 ms.
Suppose _MATH_, where _MATH_. 
From _MATH_, we get _MATH_, and from _MATH_, _MATH_, we get that _MATH_ satisfies all conditions of Theorem _REF_, so _MATH_ has exactly one fixed point _MATH_, and _MATH_; obviously, other results are valid.
Indirect taxes/subsidies, such as education subsidies, are not optimally zero under non-linear income taxation with weakly separable preferences. 
This bolsters the findings by _CITE_ and _CITE_ who investigated the desirability of non-zero commodity taxes and deviations from production efficiency in general equilibrium settings with endogenous wages. 
In the current model, education should optimally be taxed or subsidized under non-linear income taxation to exploit factor price changes for redistribution, and the _CITE_ theorem does not apply to education subsidies. 
Moreover, since education choices are generally not efficient, the Diamond-Mirrlees production efficiency theorem ceases to apply to individual human capital production as well. 
The intuition is that, due to the non-linearity of the policy schedules, the optimal policies do not constitute a perfect profit tax on the rents from human capital formation. 
As a result, consumption and investment choices cannot be (weakly) separated, which is a prerequisite for the production efficiency theorem to apply. 
In the absence of general equilibrium effects, education would not be taxed or subsidized on a net basis, and would be efficient.
It is clear from Fig. _REF_ that the stability of the _MATH_ filter is totally relying on the position of the zeros of the graphical sums in our transfer function denominator (poles). 
As we increase _MATH_, the outside Nyquist contours are "pilling up" and we see clearly the limiting "outside" Nyquist contour is not encircling the point _MATH_.
Previous approaches _CITE_ to automatic TMA analysis demonstrated that reasonable nuclei detection and staining estimation is possible and approaches the performance of trained pathologists. 
The main drawback of these models is the requirement for (almost) perfectly processed TMA spots. 
The predominant problem in clinical practice is the high variability between and within single spots, respectively patients. 
Noise and variations are not only imposed by biology but also by technical preprocessing which comprises error prone steps like micro-cutting, punching of TMA spots and staining, which involves applying antibodies and microwaving of the tissue. 
The final step comprises scanning of the microscope slides and tiling of the TMA into single spots. 
All these steps lead to biological, technical and digital artifacts in the images resulting in distorted, blurred or obfuscated regions. 
Thus, trained pathologists do not take into account the whole spot when manually analyzing TMAs, but restrict themselves to regions of high quality only. 
This preference could also be observed during extensive labeling experiments for generating a "gold standard". 
Forcing pathologist to classify randomly drawn nuclei led not only to high inter-pathologist variability but also to high intra-pathologist variability (_MATH_). 
To this end, the main goal in this application scenario is to create an algorithm which is robust to tissue variations by mimicking the work-flow of trained domain experts. 
The technical tool used for developping such an algorithm is a probabilistic model for partitioning dissimilarily matrices. 
The next subsection contains a detailed desription of this model.
Observations exclude the presence of mass-degenerate superpartners for many of the SM particles, which tells us that supersymmetry is broken. 
The standard picture is that supersymmetry breaking occurs in a hidden sector of SM gauge singlets, via the condensation of an auxiliary (_MATH_ or _MATH_) component of one or more superfields _MATH_. 
Gauge symmetry then requires any superpotential couplings between the visible and hidden sectors to be nonrenormalizable. 
In many cases of interest, all low-energy effects of supersymmetry breaking can be represented by such effective nonrenormalizable superpotential, gauge-kinetic, and Kahler terms, as in _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ are dimensionless coefficients. 
_MATH_ is the vacuum expectation value of a hidden-sector superfield, and the SUSY-breaking terms in the Lagrangian are found by replacing _MATH_ and _MATH_ in (_REF_). 
This can be illustrated as follows. 
The MSSM, by assumption, does not have any direct renormalizable couplings to the hidden sector. 
Assume then that the lightest "messenger", i.e., degree of freedom that couples both to the field _MATH_ and to the MSSM fields, has mass _MATH_. 
Below its mass scale, it can be integrated out of the theory, giving rise to operators as in (_REF_)-(_REF_). 
This is what happens, for example, in models of gauge mediation (see below).
By definition, _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ is a sequence of i.i.d. random matrices with _MATH_. 
By Law of large number we have _MATH_, almost surely. 
In addition, since _MATH_ is a continuos function of its argument, we obtain _MATH_, almost surely. 
Therefore, _MATHDISP_, whence we obtain _MATH_, with high probability.
Lemma 2.1 A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic mean square stability of the trivial solution of (2.41) is _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_
Statistics of Ionospheric Responses to the Same Side and Opposite Side Events
Throughout our paper, a _MATH_-regular graph of girth _MATH_ is called a _MATH_ -graph, a smallest _MATH_-graph is called a cage, and the order of a _MATH_-cage is denoted by _MATH_. 
The existence of _MATH_-graphs for all pairs _MATH_ and _MATH_ has been established in the 1960's twice in almost simultaneous papers by Erd os and Sachs in _CITE_ and by Sachs alone in _CITE_. 
While the proof in _CITE_ is essentially non-constructive, the proof in _CITE_ relies on a construction we call in this paper a generalized truncation. 
To this day, Sachs' construction is one of the few universal constructions (i.e., constructions that work for any choice of _MATH_ and _MATH_) completely void of algebraic arguments. 
This is in stark contrast with the fact that the majority of the best _MATH_-constructions (constructions resulting in graphs of the smallest order) both rely on the use of algebraic arguments and result in graphs possessing a high level of symmetry.
Denote the points that are contained in the interior of a translate by _MATH_. 
Because of the hereditary Lindel√∂f property, countably many translates cover _MATH_. 
If a point _MATH_ is covered _MATH_ times, then because of the nice property of _MATH_, a halfdisc from _MATH_ centered at _MATH_ is covered by these translates. 
We say that this (one of these) halfdisc(s) belongs to _MATH_. 
Take a partition of _MATH_ into countably many sets _MATH_ such that the _MATH_ halfdisc belongs to the points of _MATH_. 
Now it is enough to show that _MATH_ can be covered by countably many translates. 
Denote the halfdisc belonging to the points of _MATH_ by _MATH_. 
Using the hereditary Lindel√∂f property for _MATH_ and open discs (not halfdiscs!) with the radius of _MATH_ centered at the points of _MATH_, we obtain a countable covering of _MATH_. 
Now replacing the open discs with closed halfdiscs still gives a covering of _MATH_ because otherwise we would have _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is in the interior of _MATH_, but interior of _MATH_ is covered by the interiors of translates of _MATH_, which would imply _MATH_, contradiction. 
Finally we can replace each of the halfdiscs belonging to the points of _MATH_ by _MATH_ translates of _MATH_, we are done.
Figure _REF_ shows the number of closed loop intervals as a function of the duration of the intervals. 
It can be seen that there is no time series longer than 45 minutes. 
This is due to the fact that the gondola had problems stabilizing the telescope to within _MATH_45 arcsec (range of the fast tip-tilt mirror) whenever shear winds occurred. 
Between Norway and Greenland, over the free ocean, wind gusts occurred less often than over Greenland or over the many coastlines during the last day. 
The lack of bandwidth of the gondola pointing system to correct wind gusts is one of the problems that were found during the flight. 
The overall observation time with image stabilization, i.e. without the observation overhead (flatfielding, calibrations, repointing etc) was more than 33 h.
The differential operator _MATHDISP_, plays a central role in the study of such forms (see _CITE_ for example). 
Proposition 3.2 of _CITE_ gives _MATHDISP_.
We use a tri-gram language model trained on Arabic text collection of over 217 million words based on a vocabulary of 120 thousand words.
The states of the automaton can be updated in various ways. 
The most straightforward way is by updating all the cells simultaneously: _MATHDISP_. 
However, this method often results in so-called checkerboard patterns. 
One way to avoid these patterns is to first update only those cells for which the cell number is even, leaving the cells characterised by an odd cell number unchanged (figure _REF_). 
This results in an intermediate state that is used to update the odd cells, leaving the even cells unchanged.
As a direct consequence we further note that _MATH_ is an orthonormal basis in _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the countable product of the probability measures _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
The vector-valued spaces _MATH_ as well as the Bochner spaces _MATH_, _MATH_ are to be understood similarly.
The idea of using non-interference lemmas for parameterized model checking is attributed to McMillan _CITE_, Chou _CITE_ and Li _CITE_, which is also called CMP method. 
The CMP approach to parameterized verification is a combination of data type reduction and compositional reasoning. 
In this approach, a model checker is used as proof assistant and the user guides the proof by supplying invariants or noninterference lemmas. 
Similar types of reasoning have been applied by Chen to verify non-parameterized hierarchical protocols _CITE_. 
The compositional method of McMillan used compositional reasoning to handle infinite state systems including directory based protocols. 
This technique, which requires user intervention at various stages, has been applied to verify safety and liveness properties of the FLASH protocol. 
The paper by Chou _CITE_ presented a method along similar lines that was used to verify safety of FLASH and GERMSN's protocol. 
Krstic _CITE_ gave a formalization of the method. 
The CMP method scales well. 
As far as we are aware, the CMP method is one of the few methods to handle the full complexity of the FLASH protocol. 
Intel used CMP to verify an industrial-strength cache protocol several orders of magnitude larger than even the FLASH protocol _CITE_. 
Talupur and M. Tuttle showed how to derive high-quality invariants from message flows and use these invariants to accelerate CMP Method _CITE_. 
A message flow is a sequence of messages set among processors during the execution of a protocol. 
The hardest part of using CMP is finding a set of protocol invariants that enable CMP to coverage. 
The user has the burden of coming up with non-interference lemmas which can be non-trivial and require deep understanding of the protocol under verification.
The probability of moving to a stake _MATH_, which is linked to the current stake with silk draglines is: _MATHDISP_
We introduce the _MATH_-hierarchy of parameterized complexity classes in the tower _MATHDISP_ Presumably, all the inclusions are proper. 
The W-Hierarchy gives us means of comparing parameterized problems that are presumably not in FPT, with respect to the "strength" of their parameterized intractability. 
The key idea is to use a form of circuit depth in defining the classes. 
We discuss the remarkable fact that "almost all" (or at least a very large percentage) of the natural parameterized problems investigated to date, are precisely complete for one of the first three classes in this hierarchy, a remarkable empirical finding that supports the definitional framework. 
We also introduce a natural generalization called the _MATH_-hierarchy, about which only a little (but for exact parameterized complexity analysis, a useful little), is so far known.
The communication cost of the ATOM layer is related to three things: (i) request frequency, (ii) convergence of the system and (iii) effectiveness in the termination of self-organisation. 
The parent and child requests decrease during convergence 40%-45% and 25%-35% respectively. 
This is caused by the effect of the reconfigurations and the increase in the tree connectivity. 
In contrast, rejections increase 25%-30% as there are more nodes already connected that can potentially reject requests. 
After convergence, the number of messages is stabilised. 
At this point the system can be terminated and thus, alleviate the network from this constant communication overhead. 
Removal and acknowledgement messages decrease proportionally to the convergence time. 
This is expected, as nodes in a tree with 100% connectivity do not perform any removals or acknowledgements. 
Note that, the communication cost of the PAROS layer is constant and dependent on the network size and the gossiping period.
Define the constants _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
From representations _REF_, _REF_, _REF_, it easily follows that all the constants are defined correctly and _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, for every solution _MATH_ of _REF_-_REF_ the following inequalities hold: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, if _MATH_ is non-negative, then _MATHDISP_, where the constants _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are the best possible.
We define the observation value at time _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_, and its observation function is _MATHDISP_, Therefore, we can get the following form _MATHDISP_. 
In this system, the state of objects are in Euclidean coordinates systems, while observation values are in polar coordinates systems. 
Consequently, the observation equation is nonlinear. 
We may now linearize _MATH_ around _MATH_ and obtain the observation matrix _MATHDISP_. 
In Eq. (_REF_), _MATH_ is the observation noise, modeled as zero-mean white noise whose correlation matrix is defined by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the dimension of _MATH_, and here _MATH_.
(Eichler-Selberg trace formula) Let _MATH_ be an even integer and _MATH_ an integer. 
The trace of _MATH_ acting on _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_.
We will partition _MATH_ into two trees, _MATH_ and _MATH_, such that each of _REF_CompBSP_MATH_ and _REF_CompBSP_MATH_ is an auto-partition (however performing both of them successively may not be an auto-partition). 
We will also define two polygonal domains, _MATH_ and _MATH_, bounded by some extended boundary segments. 
The domains _MATH_ and _MATH_ jointly cover all boundary segments. 
For _MATH_, _REF_CompBSP_MATH_ partitions domain _MATH_ into cells that each intersect at most _MATH_ boundary segments. 
Out of the two possible autopartitions we perform the _REF_CompBSP_MATH_, _MATH_, where domain _MATH_ contains at least half of the boundary segments of _MATH_. 
Then we recursively call _REF_SubAuto_MATH_ in those subcells _MATH_ that still intersect more that _MATH_ segments in _MATH_. 
At each level of this recursion, every remaining boundary segment is cut _MATH_ times. 
So throughout the recursion, each boundary segment is cut on average _MATH_ times. 
_REF_CompBSP_MATH_ cuts any segment _MATH_ disjoint from the boundary segments _MATH_ times. 
Since at most half of the boundary segments survive each recursive call, altogether an interior segment is cut _MATH_ times.
Further, though both the dark components (DE and DM) evolve differently, but cosmic observations predict their energy densities of the same order today. 
To overcome this Coincidence problem [26], both the dark components are assumed to interact non-gravitationally [27] through an additional term in the conservation equations. 
Also in the perspective of the present data the DE should be chosen such that there is a smooth transition across the phantom barrier from the above in near past [28].
Data clustering algorithms are strictly related to the characteristics of the involved datasets. 
For that reason, data must be processed in order to grant that the features that will be considered for the clustering are properly normalized; scale, normalization, and standardization must be applied before performing the actual clustering.
Case-III Bandpass response: 
The transfer function is given in equation (_REF_). 
The peak frequency _MATH_ can be calculated by solving the nonlinear equation given below. _MATHDISP_ Where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_.
The co-occurrence matrix contains a considerable mass of information difficult to handle, for this why its not used directly but through so-scaled texture metrics or Haralick texture features _CITE_. 
To use this co-occurrence matrix fourteen metrics have been defined by Haralick, which correspond to global descriptions metrics of texture in specific area (i.e these metrics describe the nature of the spatial dependencies between the set of pixels which composes the target). 
For target description based on texture analysis through co-occurrence distribution we propose to use six of Haralick texture metrics proved as discriminant _CITE_. 
The selected metrics are:
Proof. 
The proof follows the same lines as the proof of Lemma _REF_. 
First note that _REF_ can readily be obtained as for Eq. _REF_ in Lemma _REF_. 
Equation _REF_ can be obtained on noting that, on the interval _MATH_, the system output can be expressed as: _MATHDISP_
(3) If _MATH_ and if _MATH_, we define _MATH_ by _MATH_, where _MATH_. 
This automorphism satisfyies _MATH_.
Many algorithms working on (sometimes very large) medical volume data sets exhibit very long run times. 
Since they may produce (false) results due a wrong choice of parameters, these may have to be corrected by the user either by selecting other parameters and re-running the computation or correcting the results manually. 
Therefore, one of the core concepts of YaDiV is the heavy use of multi-threading for every time consuming method, thus not blocking the graphical user interface (GUI). 
The user can observe the process with an animated visualization of the intermediate results, e.g. a segmentation method, and manually abort them at every stage.
A wide variety of covering tour or covering path problems have been recently investigated by Arkin et al. _CITE_, where one has to find a polygonal tour for a cutter so that it sweeps out ( mills) a specified region, in order to minimize a cost that depends mainly on the number of turns. 
These problems arise naturally in manufacturing applications, automatic tool path generation, automatic inspection systems, robotic exploration, and other areas. 
Many of these milling problems (in both-tour and path formulations) are NP-hard even restricted to orthogonal polygons and axis-aligned motion of the cutting tool: for instance, discrete milling, orthogonal milling, and integral orthogonal milling fall in this category, see _CITE_ for details. 
In our paper the region to be traversed is: (i) a cube or a box in _MATH_, or (ii) an arbitrary set of points-and we look at both variants in higher dimensions. 
In the first part, we study what are the best ways to traverse a cube or a box in _MATH_, in minimizing the number of turns of an axis-aligned spanning path. 
In the final part we study the same question when traversing arbitrary sets of points in _MATH_.
Hence, there is only one root in the circle of radius 2, and this root is a real negative number. 
All other roots in the _MATH_-plane will produce _MATH_-values greater than _MATH_, since _MATHDISP_. 
Repeating a similar analysis for _MATH_, we can prove that the function _MATH_ in (_REF_) has exactly one real negative root in the open circle of radius _MATH_. 
The other two roots in the _MATH_-plane will produce _MATH_-values greater than _MATH_, since _MATHDISP_.
Figure 8 displays the distributions of the peak frequency with the low energy cutoff. 
It is shown from Figure 8 that there is a good linear relationship between the logarithms of the peak frequency and the low energy cutoff, _MATH_. 
, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The correlation efficiency _MATH_ (0.980) and standard error _MATH_ (0.033) are given in Table 3 for the linear fit between the logarithms of the peak frequency and the low energy cutoff for the X-mode.
Zelen and Feinleib (1969) _CITE_ in their first paper on screening proposed the disease progressive model: the disease develops by progressing through 3 states, denoted by _MATH_ (Fig. _REF_). 
_MATH_ refers to the disease-free state or the state in which the disease cannot be detected; _MATH_ refers to the preclinical disease state, in which an asymptomatic individual unknowingly has disease that a screening exam can detect; and _MATH_ refers to the disease state at which the disease manifests itself in clinical symptoms. 
The progressive disease model describes the natural history of lesions detected by screening for cancer. 
The goal of screening programs is to detect the cancer in the preclinical state (_MATH_). 
The paper discussed probability modeling in cancer screening where an individual is examined only once. 
It clearly defined some concepts or key parameters in cancer screening programes that are widely used until today, such as sensitivity, transition probability from the disease-free state to the preclinical state, and sojourn time distribution in the preclinical state.
Nota bene: Particular case _MATH_ is the simplest Malmsten's integral _REF_; case _MATH_ is also known, see e.g., _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_. 
Result for the case _MATH_ can be found in _CITE_. 
Integral _MATH_ was also treated in _CITE_, but the presented formula differs from the above ones and contains the derivative of the Riemann _MATH_-function. 
As regards integrals with higher _MATH_, they seem to be never evaluated before in literature.
We assume again a scalar image _MATH_. 
The moments of region _MATH_ in image _MATH_ are defined by _MATHDISP_ for non-negative integers _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The sum _MATH_ defines the order of the moment. 
There is only one moment _MATHDISP_ of order zero. 
If _MATH_ in _MATH_, then _MATH_, the area of _MATH_. 
The moments of order 1, _MATHDISP_ define the centroid _MATH_ of _MATH_ as follows: _MATHDISP_ Note that the centroid depends on the values of _MATH_ over _MATH_, not just on the shape of _MATH_.
In this work we could show that nickel undergoes similar processes in the solar corona as other low-FIP elements which confirms the FIP effect known from earlier works.
Another relevant examination for the comparison of the non-recursive flat parametrization with the recursive approach is the analysis of the computation times. 
There not only the cyclic times have to be compared to each other, but the off-line costs are significant as well. 
Where the recursive method does not need any off-line calculations at all, the most effort for the non-recursive method lies there. 
To point out this huge effort, the off-line calculations exceeded the possibilities of the code-generation process of the used Maple environment for the mentioned robot system. 
In comparison, the cyclic computation time for the recursive approach was measured on a Automation PC APC680 from Bernecker &amp; Rainer and resulted in 646,5 _MATH_s without any computational optimizations.
On the other hand, left part of the last equation may be computed by the residue theorem _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ are the isolated singularities of the integrand lying within the strip _MATH_, and _MATH_ are those whose imaginary part is exactly 0 or _MATH_ (i.e., they lie on the integration path). 
By equating right-hand sides of _REF_ and of _REF_, we get _MATHDISP_. 
Now, on taking real parts, we obtain _MATHDISP_, while equating imaginary parts yields _MATHDISP_. 
Rewriting first equation for _MATH_ and second one for _MATH_, and recalling that _MATH_ for any real _MATH_ except zero, we arrive at integral _REF_ _MATHDISP_. 
and at another integral: _MATHDISP_ 
For the logarithmic integral, particular case _MATH_ may be of special interest. 
From _REF_, we easily get _MATHDISP_. 
In contrast, for the arctangent integral, limiting case _MATH_ reveals to be more interesting. 
The fact that _MATH_ gives the opportunity to evaluate integrals of some odd functions over interval _MATH_. 
Making _MATH_, we obtain from _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ 
If _MATH_ is odd then _MATH_, while if _MATH_ is even the last integral vanishes identically.
- for almost all _MATH_ the functions _MATH_ are continuous on _MATH_ [85].
The kinematics was characterized by a quite impulsive acceleration, with a peak value of 470 m s_MATH_ (Figure 3, bottom panel). 
Such an acceleration is difficult to explain in terms of a simple model proposed by Vrsnak (1990c), even assuming an excessive drainage of material from the prominence body (see Figure 7 of Vrsnak (1990c) or Figure 5a of Vrsnak et al. (1993)).
Similarly equating the _MATH_ element to zero we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Now, substituting the allowed values of _MATH_ and _MATH_ we obtain _MATHDISP_ for normal hierarchy and _MATHDISP_, for Inverted Hierarchy (_MATH_). 
Thus, implying that the neutrino mass matrix having texture one-zero with vanishing _MATH_ obeys Normal Hierarchy.
A minimum vertex cover (_MATH_) of a graph _MATH_ is the set of vertices of _MATH_ that is a vertex cover which has the minimum cardinality among all possible vertex covers.
Not all Minkowski polynomials _MATH_ are H-Stable: any univariate polynomial with nonnegative coefficients _MATH_ such that _MATH_ can be presented as _MATH_ for some convex compact subsets (simplexes) _MATH_ _CITE_. 
Fortunately, a modification of the inductive proof in _CITE_ works for Minkowski polynomials and presented in the next Section.
Note that the convexity condition for _MATH_ in Assumption _REF_ does not typically assumed for continuous-time systems but it is motivated by _CITE_, where an example illustrates that the convexity condition is used to guarantee robustness to disturbances for hybrid systems and the results presented in this chapter are based on the robustness properties of hybrid dynamical systems. 
In particular, consider a hybrid system _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_ that is inflated from system _MATH_ by a small parameter _MATH_: _MATHDISP_, where the data _MATH_ are defined as _MATHDISP_.
Inductively, by Theorems _REF_, _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_ we conclude that we can use policy iteration algorithms to obtain a policy that is _MATH_-bias optimal. 
In particular, in a finite number of iterations we can obtain a policy that is _MATH_-bias optimal for all _MATH_ by using the _MATH_-bias policy iteration algorithm.
In the paper of Moser and Veselov _CITE_ dedicated to the complete integrability of certain dynamical systems, the authors proposed a discretization of the tangent bundle _MATH_ of a configuration space _MATH_ replacing it by the product _MATH_, approximating a tangent vector on _MATH_ by a pair of "close" points _MATH_. 
In this sense, the continuous Lagrangian function _MATH_ is replaced by a discretization _MATH_. 
Then, applying a suitable variational principle, it is possible to derive the discrete equations of motion. 
In the regular case, one obtains an evolution operator, a map which assigns to each pair _MATH_ a pair _MATH_, sharing many properties with the continuous system, in particular, symplecticity, momentum conservation and a good energy behavior. 
We refer to _CITE_ for an excellent review in discrete Mechanics (on _MATH_) and its numerical implementation.
In Model A and Model B we used a numerical domain bounded at _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ with the grid of 256_MATH_256_MATH_512 elements, while in Model C we used a numerical domain bounded at _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ with the grid of 512_MATH_512_MATH_512 elements. 
(The side boundaries are located far enough to minimize their effect on the reconnection inside the domain.)
The topology of the rear suspension submodel is more complex, see Fig. _REF_ right, as kinematic loops arise. 
As stated above, both wheel carriers and the suspension subframe may rotate with respect to a auxiliary body about an axis normal to the plane of symmetry of the vehicle, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
The rotational degrees of freedom of both rear wheels with respect to the corresponding wheel carrier are represented by _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, allowing the wheels to rotate about axes normal to the plane of symmetry of the vehicle. 
The swinging arm is linked to the suspension subframe via two rods. 
These two rods may rotate relative to the subframe about inclined axes in planes parallel to the plane of symmetry of the vehicle, that intersect the axis of rotation of the suspension subframe, _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
The swinging arm may rotate with respect to the bottom left rod about an axis, that is parallel to the axis of rotation of both rods, _MATH_. 
As the swinging arm has one degree of freedom with respect to the suspension subframe, two constraints are required to restrain its motion. 
Thus, translations of the respective body-fixed coordinate frames of the bottom right rod and the swinging arm in a plane oriented normal to the above described axis of rotation are locked, _MATH_. 
The swinging arm is connected to the wheel carriers via two rods, that may rotate spherical with respect to the swinging arm with _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, restraining the rotation of the rods about their longitudinal axis. 
All translations between the respective body-fixed frames of the wheel carriers and the corresponding rods, _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, are constrained, and thus both wheel carriers connected to each other and to the suspension subframe via the swinging arm. 
The model of the actuators to directly tilt the vehicle consists of two bodies: 
The bottom bodies of the actuators are spherically joined to the suspension subframe and may rotate with _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, restraining the rotation of the actuator parts with respect to their longitudinal axis. 
The top bodies of the actuators may move with respect to the bottom bodies with one translational degree of freedom each, _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, in direction of the axes defined by the pivot points of the respective actuators. 
Finally, all translations between the respective body-fixed frames of the top bodies of the actuators and the corresponding wheel carriers, _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, are constrained. 
Hence, the degree of freedom of the rear suspension substructure is four with respect to the auxiliary body, and the degree of freedom of the full vehicle model is 14, including 16 constraints. 
The independent variables representing the degrees of freedom of the vehicle are encircled in Fig. _REF_.
Moreover, we define _MATH_ to be the supremum of the radius _MATH_ in the statement (_MATH_) for _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The second relation implies that the type of _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
1. 
We show the equivalence between (1) and (2). 
With Proposition _REF_, (1) implies (2). 
Conversely, we assume (2). 
Then we have the expansion _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_. 
_MATH_ since _MATH_ in the non tangential limit _MATH_, _MATH_.
The recent avalanche of observational discoveries and identifications of various magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in solar coronal structures have made the study of waves and oscillations a mainstream activity of coronal physics (see Nakariakov and Verwichte 2005 for a review). 
A significant part of these discoveries was made with imaging telescopes (SOHO/EIT, TRACE, Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)) operating in the EUV and microwave bands. 
So far, the search for events, interesting for a more detailed analysis (the pre-analysis of the data), has been carried out "by eye"-the researcher had to scan "manually" full-resolution data cubes, looking for oscillatory patterns. 
Obviously, this approach cannot be considered either as efficient or robust, especially taking into account that some coronal oscillatory events, such as propagating and standing longitudinal modes, are not associated with flaring energy releases. 
Solar coronal wave studies would certainly benefit from the development and implementation of pre-analysis tools for the automated detection of wave and oscillatory phenomena in imaging data cubes. 
The expected outcome of an automated detection method is a reduction of the analysed data cube to a 1D or 2D signal, showing spatial or temporal location of harmonic patterns. 
The tools for the pre-analysis should not be confused with the data analysis tools. 
The main qualities of a pre-analysis tool is its robustness (the majority of the phenomena in interest should be findable with the method), the calculation speed (e.g. the time taken to pre-analyse the data set should be shorter than the duration of the observation) and its clear and simple outcome. 
The upcoming high-cadence large field-of-view data from imaging instruments Hinode/XRT and SDO/AIA makes this task even more timely.
Combining (2.28) with (2.6) we get _MATHDISP_ 
In the second step Euler formula is used and we have _MATHDISP_ (2.29) can be changed to _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ 
Then _MATH_ is the inverse Fourier transformer of _MATH_. 
Therefore _REF_ is a general differentiator formula. 
From (2.30) we get _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and H(v) are the amplitude of _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively. 
From (2.12) we know that _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_
No, we assume that the displacements are small _MATH_ and we introduce _MATH_ to get: _MATHDISP_
We have studied the alias-component matrices of nonuniform transmultiplexers. 
This has resulted in an input-output analysis of nonuniform transmultiplexers in the frequency domain. 
Based on alias-component matrices, it has been shown that an _MATH_ design can achieve a low cross-talk and near perfect reconstruction.
Corollary 2.1. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the fundamental solution of (2.1), which are given in (2.8) and (2.9), respectively. 
Let _MATH_, and let _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ be nonnegative integers. 
Then we have _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Also we have _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_.
Let _MATH_. 
By Theorem _REF_ the sequence _MATH_ of the distributions of _MATH_ tends to compact set _MATH_. 
Hence, the set of partial limits of _MATH_ is nonempty and is contained in _MATH_. 
Then, for any sequence _MATH_, there exists a subsequence _MATH_ and a measure _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_. 
But this means that _MATH_, as _MATH_. 
As _MATH_ is the distribution of _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We have thus proved the condition (_REF_), i.e. for every _MATH_: _MATHDISP_, which completes the proof of the first part of Theorem _REF_.
Figure _REF_ shows the maps of ratios _MATH_ and _MATH_ (given by Equations (4) and (5)) and field strength _MATH_. 
The maps indicate that the contributions of _MATH_ and _MATH_ are opposite to each other at all the time and both have alternating band pattern around the umbrae.
Fundamental observation: 
The constructions of the connections _MATH_, respectively _MATH_, are quite natural and elementary but it is Proposition _REF_, respectively its more general relative Proposition _REF_, that serve as an actual justification for the introduction of these objects. 
Proposition _REF_ allows us to analyze the parallel transport of homotopy types of maps from the complex _MATH_ to complexes _MATH_, where _MATH_, providing a key for a resolution of the Lovasz conjecture in the case when _MATH_ is an odd integer.
If _MATH_, _MATH_, then there exist _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Proposition _REF_ together with (_REF_)-(_REF_) gives that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Substitute the boundary condition _MATH_ into (_REF_), one has _MATHDISP_, and substitute the boundary condition _MATH_ into (_REF_), one has _MATHDISP_. 
By the same way, if we substitute the condition (_REF_) into (_REF_), then we can obtain that _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Conversely, if (_REF_)-(_REF_) hold, setting _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
It is easy to check that the above _MATH_ satisfy the equation (_REF_)-(_REF_). 
Thus, (_REF_) and (_REF_) hold.
The session IDs produced by modern web servers is typically a hash (SHA1 or MD5) of a pseudo-random number manipulated by some salt-a random value based on the client, such as his IP address or the timestamp of the login, or both. 
Thus the bits of entropy now depend on the output of the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) as well as the salt extracted from the client. 
The botnet operator can still attempt to guess these bits by brute-force, but the claim above shows that the attack takes exponentially longer with more bits of entropy. 
A different approach is required.
We next argue more formally for the correctness of the reduction. 
Suppose _MATH_ is a weight _MATH_ truth assignment that satisfies _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ denote the set of variables set to true and let _MATH_ denote the _MATH_ variable of _MATH_ (ordered by the indices of the variables in _MATH_).
We introduce some notation. 
For _MATH_ and _MATH_, we consider _MATH_ defined by _MATHDISP_. 
Recall that for _MATH_, the determinants of quaternionic matrices are defined only for hermitian matrices, see _CITE_ and _CITE_. 
Note that _MATHDISP_, and that _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
We also adopt the convention that _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
In general, _MATH_ is the _MATH_-th elementary symmetric function of the eigenvalues _MATH_ of _MATH_; this notation and most of our calculations do not depend on the dimension _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the open subset of _MATH_ such that if _MATH_ then the polynomial in _MATH_ defined by _MATH_ has only distinct real roots.
Charged particle accelerations in the reconnecting current sheet was first studied by Speiser (1965), who discussed the particle acceleration in the geomagnetic tail current sheet and investigated the effect of the residual magnetic field vertical to the sheet plane on the particle trajectory and the energy the particle finally obtained. 
Meanwhile, it is found analytically and numerically that a group of particles of the Maxwellian distribution passing through the reconnection region, and the energy spectrum of these particles possess an exponential at high energies (Bulanov and Sasorov, 1976). 
Martens (1988) applied Speiser's results to the similar process occuring in the coronal environment, and confirmed that the effective acceleration distance of electrons and protons in the current sheet is far less than their mean free paths. 
Then Martens and Young (1990) conducted a further study on the motion of protons in the current sheet. 
They found that a charged particle can acquire energy only when it moves along the electric field in the current sheet, and that the existence of the residual magnetic field influences the trajectory of the particle, causing the particle to leave the current sheet in the middle of the acceleration process and therefore limiting its energy gain. 
Later, Litvinenko and Somov (1993) and Litvinenko (1996) considered the motion of particles in the presence of a guide magnetic field (the magnetic field parallel or anti-parallel to the induced electric field). 
They found that the guide field can effectively trap the charged particle, keep it stay in the current sheet longer, and thus keep it acquire more energy. 
Using the test particle approach, Zharkova and Gordovskyy (2004) repeated the work by Litvinenko (1996), and found that the existence of the guide field cannot only trap the charged particles in the accelerating area longer and allow them to get more energy, but also separate electrons and protons totally or partly from one another. 
Separated electrons and protons move downward along magnetic lines with different velocities to the different footpoints of flare loops, yielding a time delay between the hard X-ray emissions observed at different footpoints.
Causality and resulting analyticity imply that a correlator can be represented through a spectral function. 
For the quark propagator this representation is given by _MATHDISP_, where the Dirac structure of the spectral function is parameterized as _MATHDISP_. 
Our conventions are chosen such that the scalar dressing functions themselves agree with those introduced in Ref. _CITE_ using Minkowski space conventions. 
Assuming a positive definite Fock space, the dressing functions furthermore obey _MATHDISP_ and the sum rules _MATHDISP_, where here _MATH_ is the wave function renormalization constant and not the plasmino residue which will be introduced later.
Although panel data offer many advantages, they are not panacea. 
The power of panel data to isolate the effects of specific actions, treatments or more general policies depends critically on the compatibility of the assumptions of statistical tools with the data generating process. 
In choosing a proper method for exploiting the richness and unique properties of the panel, it might be helpful to keep the following factors in mind: First, what advantages do panel data offer us in investigating economic issues over data sets consisting of a single cross section or time series? 
Second, what are the limitations of panel data and the econometric methods that have been proposed for analyzing such data? 
Third, are the assumptions underlying the statistical inference procedures and the data-generating process compatible. 
Fourth, when using panel data, how can we increase the efficiency of parameter estimates and reliability of statistical inference?
Proof: 
The LT of the busy period of an M/M/1 has branching points at _MATH_, see the proof of Lemma _REF_. 
Therefore the branching points of _MATH_ (and by (_REF_) also those of _MATH_) are given by the solutions to _MATHDISP_, so that the largest of these is _MATH_ as given in (_REF_). 
_MATH_ _MATH_ has a pole at _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_, for all parameter values that satisfy _MATH_ and the following criterion, _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ is not fulfilled, _MATH_ has no negative pole.
Finally, we introduce additional spatial information, over a broader area than the structural information captured in the line support regions, by means of probabilistic relaxation. 
Although relaxation improves classification slightly, the improvement comes at substantial computational cost. 
Therefore, we recommend that this approach be used only in applications where the improvement is absolutely necessary.
A Single Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation Scheme Based on Gradient Based Adaptive Filtering
In the measurement error _MATH_ is normally distributed, as it is usually assumed, then _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, so Eqs. (_REF_) and (_REF_) simplify to _MATHDISP_. 
Both equations relate well-known stories: the latter is obviously solved by the mean, _MATH_, while the former tells us that this _MATH_ also minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the measured data and _MATH_. 
Similarly, one can show that the median minimizes the sum _MATH_. 
The arithmetic mean and the median are just special cases of _MATH_-estimates. 
_MATH_ _MATH_-estimates are devised as weighted averages and as such they are also computed _CITE_. 
For most realistic distributions _MATH_ and _MATH_ exists, so that _MATH_ is approximately linear near the origin. 
Equation (_REF_) can then be written as _MATHDISP_ or _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the weight function. 
The essence of a good _MATH_-estimate is the choice of a weight function that sufficiently damps the outliers at large _MATH_. 
Many functions are in use, based on the presumed distributions of the measurement errors. 
In terms of robustness, good representatives are the Tukey function _MATHDISP_ and the Cauchy function _MATHDISP_, shown in Fig. _REF_. 
When _MATH_ is increased in the Tukey function, more distant outliers are admitted while the robustness of the _MATH_-estimate is reduced; on the other hand, its asymptotic efficiency increases (and vice-versa). 
The values _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ correspond to asymptotic efficiencies _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ (asymptotic efficiency has been defined on page _REF_).
In this contribution we build on the seminal paper by _CITE_, which presented a diffusion model incorporating group selection, and study a group selection pressure towards the coexistence of two types of templates that are differentiated by their replication rates. 
Our focus is on the effect of template swapping (migration) among protocells. 
This is a key process within the modern prebiotic scenario, which is based on the radical notion of an ancestral community of cell lines lacking long-term genetic history and individuality, rather than of a single ancestral organism _CITE_.
Expressing _MATH_ in terms of _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Then it becomes obvious from _REF_ and the expressions for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ that _REF_ is true since _MATH_.
Given a weighted game _MATH_ we say that two players _MATH_ are undistinguished, _MATH_, if there exists two proportional maximal payoffs _MATH_ with large and small payoffs, that is _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Two players _MATH_ are equal in precedence, _MATH_, if _MATH_ or there exists a chain of undistinguished pair of players beginning with player _MATH_ and ending with player _MATH_. 
Player _MATH_ strictly precedes player _MATH_, _MATH_, if they are not equal in precedence and there exists _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Finally, player _MATH_ precedes player _MATH_, _MATH_, if either player _MATH_ strictly precedes player _MATH_ or both players are equal in precedence.
The aim of this work is to show that it is possible to construct a metamaterial to exhibit negative constitutive parameters within ultrasonic range and demonstrate that acoustic waves can exhibit exotic behavior, namely presence of localized states at the boundary between metamaterial and "normal" material and reversed Doppler effect. 
In the mathematical model both longitudinal and shear modes are included in calculations. 
Also internal dissipation losses are taken in account.
So, all conditions of Theorem _REF_ hold. 
Thus by Theorem _REF_, the BVP (_REF_) has at least one symmetric positive solution _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
(ii) Similarly, as in (i) above the main formula in Theorem _REF_ yields the following characterization for every _MATH_, _MATHDISP_; this last formula is also a simple consequence of the characterization given in _CITE_ for the subdifferential of the supremum of convex functions.
Proof. 
We start from (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
From (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
In exactly the same way we may prove that _MATHDISP_. 
Since union and intersection are commutative and associative operations, the right-hand sides of the last two equations are equal, so _MATHDISP_; on applying the commutative law (_REF_) to the left-hand side, we obtain _MATHDISP_.
The control equations given by (_REF_) and (_REF_) represent a system of _MATH_ scalar equations, where _MATH_ constitute _MATH_ unknowns to be solved for. 
The system is overdetermined so we need an additional _MATH_ unknowns. 
The right hand side (RHS) of (_REF_) contains the variables _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
The total dimensionality of these variables is _MATH_. 
These _MATH_ RHS variables can be partitioned into _MATH_ variables which can be specified as part of the control and _MATH_ variables which can serve as unknowns to be moved to the left hand side (LHS).
A friend talking to a handicapped person is also involved in SI (Fig. _REF_). 
She has to inform the person about the necessary treatment but abstain from patronizing. 
And again, choosing proper methods to inform the person about the treatment makes SI up.
In this section we address the problem of finding an optimal solution to _MATH_. 
For the incompatible case, we show that the problem can be solved in polynomial time. 
For the compatible case, we prove that the problem is NP-hard and provide a pseudo polynomial-time algorithm.
Whereas in _CITE_, the authors do not consider any dependence in the interruption process, Fiems et al. _CITE_ investigate a discrete time single server queue with interruptions generated by a 2-state Markov process. 
Two different service strategies considered are to continue or restart the interrupted service. 
Steady-state probability generating functions of the buffer contents, the unfinished work and the customer delay in terms of the effective customer service times are obtained for both strategies. 
The impact of both service strategies on the buffer performance is illustrated. 
Server interruptions as an on/off process with geometrically distributed on-periods and generally distributed off-periods are investigated in Fiems et al. _CITE_. 
Here the authors have brought in the additional feature of partial restarting of interrupted service unlike in the earlier reported papers.
Claim: 
We have that a) and b). 
We have that _MATH_. 
We have that _MATH_ where _MATH_. 
From Proposition _REF_ it follows that _MATH_ and _MATH_.
The parameter identification process is performed in two steps. 
First, the parameters related to the strain rate sensitivity, i.e. _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, are identified based on the secondary creep data derived from Fig. _REF_.b. 
Then, the yield stress _MATH_ and the parameters related to the hardening and recovery functions, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, can be determined from the stress-strain data shown in Fig. _REF_.a.
The simplest solution of our model equation is a plane wave solution of form _MATH_ with _MATH_ for the unstaggered case (adjacent elements are in-phase) and _MATH_ for the staggered case (adjacent elements are out-of-phase). 
In the staggered case, the plane wave amplitude reads: _MATH_ whereas _MATH_. 
According to the literature _CITE_, in the presence of a self-defocusing (DF) nonlinearity, plane wave staggered solutions are modulationally unstable, which allows for the formation of staggered bright solitons, while unstaggered solutions are stable providing a stable background for the creation of unstaggered dark solitons. 
On the other hand, in the self-focusing (SF) case unstaggered plane waves are modulationally unstable, which gives rise to unstaggered bright solitons _CITE_, while the corresponding staggered solutions are stable, thus supporting staggered dark solitons. 
Because here the topic is a self-defocusing nonlinear lattice, staggered bright solitons and unstaggered dark solitons are investigated. 
The results for staggered dark solitons in SF nonlinear lattices are qualitatively the same due to the symmetry between SF and DF nonlinear lattices.
In this section we derive upper bounds for the moments of _MATH_, cf. _CITE_ for the _MATH_ system. 
These bounds provide in particular sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the moments of _MATH_ and _MATH_ needed later. 
Let _MATHDISP_, be the _MATH_-th moments of the waiting times _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Further, let _MATHDISP_, be the _MATH_-th moment of the conditional waiting time _MATH_ of an arriving request with required service time _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ be the permutation automorphism group of the code _MATH_ defined in (_REF_). 
In many cases it is known that the map _MATH_ is an isomorphism (see for example _CITE_). 
In any case, using (_REF_), we regard _MATH_ as a _MATH_-module. 
In particular, the (bijective) evaluation map _MATH_ in (_REF_) is _MATH_-equivariant.
For _MATH_, denote by _MATH_ the shifted shape corresponding to any partial filling of _MATH_ associated to _MATH_.
Remark: 
An example illustrating the positions of _MATH_ and _MATH_ when _MATH_ is given in Fig. _REF_.
Let _MATH_ be an integral curve of _MATH_ starting at _MATH_, and let _MATH_. 
The curve _MATH_ defined by _MATH_, with _MATH_ fixed, is an integral curve of _MATH_ since for an arbitrary function _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
The curve _MATH_ starts at _MATH_ and by virtue of the uniqueness of the integral curves, we have _MATHDISP_. 
On the other hand, from the definition of _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, therefore, _MATHDISP_ (cf. Definition _REF_).
Consider the mapping at _MATH_ shown in Fig. _REF_. 
The first 10 signed kneadings _MATH_ gives the polynomial _MATH_, the graph of which is shown in Fig. _REF_. 
The only zero of the polynomial gives the topological entropy _MATH_, whereas the Lyapunov exponent for the same mappings is about _MATH_; _MATH_ for the mapping with the primary homoclinics at _MATH_
More a word, we (and _CITE_ as well) only consider a strictly proper transfer matrix _MATH_. 
That is, in a minimal realization _MATH_ of _MATH_, _MATH_.
The mean vector of _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
When _MATH_, it is not difficult to verify from (_REF_) that the means of _MATH_ and _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_, respectively.
For stating the exact tail asymptotic property along the high-priority queue direction we need to define: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is given in (_REF_).
An individual's problem is given by _MATHDISP_. 
The associated benefits (paid in case of dependency) are given by _MATH_ and _MATH_ where _MATH_ is the uniform public benefit and _MATH_ the (private insurance) loading factor. 
The first-order conditions with respect to _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are _MATHDISP_. 
Using a _MATH_ to denote the optimal levels, equation (_REF_) yields _MATH_. 
Under standard INADA conditions we always have an interior solution for saving with _MATH_. 
However, the left-hand-side of expression (_REF_) can be negative at _MATH_, as stated in the following lemma (established in the Appendix). 
This is useful to determine the demand for private LTC insurance in the laissez-faire.
A cursory look at the graphs of the execution time (Figure _REF_ and Figure _REF_) tells us that the scheduling algorithms can be clearly separated into two classes: one-shot heuristics with very short execution times (min-min, chaining, HLFET, ISH and DSH) and iterative search algorithms with significant execution times (genetic algoritms, simulated annealing, tabu search and A*). 
One-shot heuristics create a solution based on various criteria, without searching through a subset of the solution space. 
Iterative search algorithms however, are considering a larger number of possible solutions before returning a preferred solution, therefore they can take a significant amount of time. 
On the other hand, most iterative search algorithms can return "current best" solutions, if stopped at any given moment of time. 
Depending on the implementation, A* might be an exception to this, as it might potentially search through incomplete solutions.
Under more restrictive integrability assumptions on the Levy measure _MATH_, this proposition would be a consequence of _CITE_ Theorems 3.11 and 3.13. 
In the appendix, we take advantage of the very specific form of the jumps that we consider to deduce it from the theory of stochastic flows for SDEs without jumps. 
To derive the put-call duality equality _REF_, we are going to check the equality of the derivatives of both sides with respect to _MATH_. 
The next result enables us to justify the formula _MATH_ obtained by formal derivation and where the indicator function on the right-hand side will be replaced thanks to _REF_. 
Its proof is also postponed to the appendix. 
Under the assumptions and notations of Proposition _REF_, when for some _MATH_, the local volatility function _MATH_ does not vanish in a neighborhood of _MATH_ in _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_. 
Last, if _MATH_ for some constant _MATH_ then _MATHDISP_ and for any sequence _MATH_ of non-zero real numbers greater than _MATH_ converging to zero, the random variables _MATH_ are uniformly integrable.
For the soliton, we have _MATH_ and scattering by the effective potential _MATH_, such that the localization exponent is predicted to be _MATHDISP_. 
Figure _REF_ shows this prediction, together with numerical data, obtained both by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian _REF_ and a transfer matrix approach, respectively _CITE_. 
We have chosen realistic experimental parameters: _MATH_ _MATH_Li atoms with scattering length _MATH_nm in a transverse trap with _MATH_kHz form a soliton of size _MATH_m_MATH_m. 
We consider an optical speckle potential with amplitude _MATH_, i.e. both the red-detuned case with _MATH_ and the blue-detuned case with _MATH_. 
Since the speckle potential has a non-Gaussian, skewed distribution, the full localization exponent depends on the absolute sign of _MATH_, an effect that the lowest-order Born approximation _MATH_ cannot capture. 
However, the overall exponential decrease for _MATH_ is correctly predicted.
Note that _MATH_ is an integer coordinate, while _MATH_ possibly be fractional coordinates in _MATH_, so it does not correspond to an integer coordinate in _MATH_, which makes it difficult to apply equation (_REF_) directly. 
In this case, we let _MATH_ be its closest integer coordinate pixel. 
Notice also that the weight _MATH_ and _MATH_ in equation (5) and (6) have been computed during the optimization step of the last optimization iteration, so they do not need to be recomputed at the upsampling step.
Therefore the trisector intersects plane _MATH_ in two points in _MATH_ (counted with multiplicity), one of which lies on _MATH_. 
Since there are an odd number of intersection points on _MATH_, plane _MATH_ intersects _MATH_ exactly once and any other branch exactly once (counted with multiplicity). 
Our shader rasterization approach is based on the execution of a more efficient algorithm for triangles covering a single or very few pixels, the cross products method of figure _REF_. 
The program requires a minimum number of 4 alive vector registers throughout the code and the proper allocation of temporary values avoids explicit MOVs or branches while still keeping a high SIMD utilization of 75% to 100% for the most part (operated components are in bold, according to the write mask), and a minimum number of instructions.
Throughout this work, we shall use the following standard notation: by _MATH_ we denote for _MATH_ the open interval _MATH_, by _MATH_ its closure, by _MATH_ its _MATH_-fold Cartesian product. 
For two sequences _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for all values of _MATH_, we identify the set _MATH_ with the countable Cartesian product _MATHDISP_. 
Throughout, we assume that the time interval of evolution of the system _REF_ is _MATH_. 
We shall denote the state of the system by _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
The parameter dependence of _MATH_ on _MATH_ is indicated by _MATH_. 
We shall also consider extensions of problem _REF_ to complex values of the parameter vector _MATH_. 
To this end, we denote by _MATH_ the set of all sequences with values in _MATH_. 
We denote _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We use standard multiindex notation: for a vector _MATH_ of parameters and for a sequence _MATH_ of nonnegative integers, we denote by _MATHDISP_. 
As any _MATH_ has only finitely many nonzero entries, the definitions _MATHDISP_ for multi-factorials, the length of a multi-index _MATH_ and for the partial derivative of order _MATH_ are well-defined for _MATH_. 
To state and prove results on existence, regularity and numerical approximation errors of solutions, we require certain function spaces. 
In what follows, we let _MATH_ denote a separable Banach space with norm _MATH_. 
We shall, by abuse of notation, denote by _MATH_ both the vector space over _MATH_ as well as its complexification over _MATH_ (i.e., an extension of _MATH_ whose restriction to real valued elements coincides with the original space _MATH_). 
We shall need spaces of (differentiable) functions with values in _MATH_. 
We denote by _MATH_ the space of functions from _MATH_ into _MATH_ which are, as _MATH_-valued functions, continuous on _MATH_ (where _MATH_ is equipped with the product topology). 
Moreover, for any _MATH_, we denote by _MATH_ the space of continuous functions _MATH_ whose _MATH_-th Frechet derivative _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_. 
These spaces _MATH_, equipped with the norms _MATHDISP_, are themselves Banach spaces. 
Similar notations are used, if the interval _MATH_ is itself replaced by another Banach space _MATH_. 
Then the derivatives _MATH_ have to be understood as Frechet derivatives, i.e., _MATH_ is a mapping from _MATH_ taking values in _MATH_, the space of bounded linear operators from _MATH_ into _MATH_.
Comparing the resistance changes _MATH_ with the relative current values _MATH_ in Fig. _REF_, the behaviour is comparable in total but different in detail. 
A formation cycle always leads to a decrease of _MATH_ and in most cases increases _MATH_ what might be regarded as a coupling between the development of Schottky contact and resistive switching. 
Having a detailed look, the influence of the _MATH_-_MATH_ cycles on the resistance change _MATH_ is much more pronounced as the described increase by formation. Especially the second measurement after each formation leads to a strong increase of _MATH_, however, subsequent measurement steps may also lead to a degradation. 
Comparing positive and negative reading voltages, i. e. 
_MATH_ at _MATH_ V and _MATH_ V, a close correlation of both values is obvious with _MATH_ always being about a factor of 3 smaller than _MATH_ what might be correlated to the Schottky-type characteristics of the junction.
We take the procedure one step further and relax R4 to only three consecutive zero feedback bits. 
This time we run into a complication. 
The bad news is that we get a one feedback bit for the last of the five output blocks. 
This triggers an additional summation at all carry cell positions, effectively pushing several ones into the carry vector. 
The problem with this is that the LFSRization effect is ruined, so we cannot hope to push the process even further to relax R4 to only two consecutive zero feedback bits. 
For the three-case, however, we can still calculate a zero vector compensation and proceed as above.
The full transmission formula for _MATH_ retains the acoustic cut-off and Brunt-Vaisala frequencies, and so should be more accurate, although also more complex. 
Both _MATH_ and _MATH_ are tested against the exact transmission _MATH_ in Section _REF_.
Assume that _MATH_ is a parity embedding of a graph _MATH_ in a closed surface _MATH_. 
Consider a small closed neighbourhood _MATH_ of _MATH_. 
So _MATH_ is a compact surface with boundary, consisting of discs around the vertices of _MATH_ and bands around the edges. 
Cut each of these bands across and then glue back with a half turn. 
This gives an orientable surface _MATH_, with boundary, and an embedding _MATH_. 
Attach discs to each of the boundary component. 
The resulting closed surface _MATH_ is orientable, with the graph _MATH_ embedded by a map _MATH_. 
In general, we cannot control the Euler characteristic of _MATH_. 
However, the forms _MATH_ and _MATH_ are closely related.
Game. 
Now we select the used primes _MATH_ used for answering signing queries not upon each signing query, but at the beginning of the experiment. 
Since the _MATH_ were selected independently anyway, this change is only conceptual. 
Let _MATH_ be the set of all _MATH_, and let _MATH_. 
We also change the selection of the elements _MATH_ used during _MATH_ as follows. 
First, we uniformly choose _MATH_ and generators _MATH_. 
We then set _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Note that we can extract an _MATH_-th root for _MATH_ from _MATH_ and for all _MATH_ from _MATH_. 
Unless none of the _MATH_ divides _MATH_, the induced distribution on _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the same as in Game . 
Since _MATH_ for primes _MATH_ and _MATH_, and we assumed that _MATH_, however, we have that _MATH_ does not divide _MATH_ (for all _MATH_). 
_MATHDISP_. 
Observe also that _MATH_ is independent of the adversary's view.
The classification that results from the argument outlined in this article can be summaried as follows.
Let _MATH_ be CONS in _MATH_. 
One has _MATHDISP_ Thus _MATHDISP_. 
Put _MATH_ ( _MATH_, _MATH_) then the above LHS is _MATHDISP_ 
The positivity of _MATH_ entails that of _MATH_ for any _MATH_. 
Let us take _MATH_ in the form _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ is positive then _MATHDISP_. 
Also if _MATH_ is negative then _MATHDISP_. 
This means that _MATH_ is non-CP.
We now recall the basic ideas that turn an arithmetic quotient of the form _MATH_ into an algebraic curve. 
Let _MATH_ be an arithmetic subgroup. 
The topological boundary of _MATH_ is _MATH_ and a point _MATH_. 
For the rational compactification of _MATH_ we do not need to consider all the boundaries _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In fact we need only to add to _MATH_ the cusps of _MATH_ (a cusp of _MATH_ is an element of _MATH_ that is fixed under the action of an element _MATH_ with the property that _MATH_). 
Any two cusps _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for an element _MATH_ are called equivalent. 
Let _MATH_ be the set of inequivalent cusps of _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is finite. 
We add this set to _MATH_ and form the space _MATH_. 
This space will be equipped with certain topology such that a basis of the neighborhoods of the points of _MATH_ is given by three type of open sets; if a point in _MATH_ is lying in _MATH_ then its neighborhoods consist of the usual open discs in _MATH_; if the point is _MATH_, i.e., the cusp _MATH_, then its neighborhoods are the set of all points lying above the line _MATH_ for any real number _MATH_; if the point is a cusp different than _MATH_ which is a rational number, then the system of neighborhoods of this point are the union of the cusp and the interior of a circle in _MATH_ tangent to the cusp. 
Under the topology whose system of open neighborhoods we just explained, _MATH_ becomes a Hausdorff non-locally compact space. 
The quotient space _MATH_ with the quotient topology is a compact Hausdorff space. 
We refer to this compact quotient as the rational compactification of _MATH_. 
For a detailed discussion we refer the reader to _CITE_.
The ends of the interval are valid positions for reinsertion in route 2 or not depending on the position of _MATH_ in _MATH_, that is denoted by _MATH_: _MATH_, when moving _MATH_ to position _MATH_ in route 2 order _MATH_ would be delivered immediately after _MATH_, and when moving it to position _MATH_- order _MATH_- would be delivered immediately before _MATH_. 
In both cases the precedence conditions imposed on stack _MATH_ to ensure that order _MATH_ is delivered before _MATH_ and after _MATH_- in route 2 are violated, producing infeasible solutions, and thus _MATH_ and _MATH_- are not valid reinsertion positions in route 2.
In Figure 2 the height-time profiles of the leading edge of the prominence and the leading edges of the two associated CMEs are plotted. 
At 07:50:47 UT the prominence was at 1.02 _MATH_, whereas the back-extrapolation of the first CME intersects 1.0 _MATH_ at 07:50 UT. 
The plot reveals strong temporal association between the prominence eruption and the first CME. 
The position angle of the second CME (not included in the LASCO CME catalog), and the position angle of the eruption of the arch-segment at the southern foot-point of the prominence (see Section 3.1 and Figure 1), suggests that they are spatially correlated. 
The H_MATH_ eruption was too large to be entirely kept within the field of view. 
Hence, the eruption of the southern foot-point could not be covered properly and we could not plot the height-time profile of its rise. 
However, the information we could gather from our data, suggests that the second CME and the eruption of southern foot-point are associated to within _MATH_ minutes.
There exist positive constants _MATH_ depending on _MATH_ and _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_, where the sequence of coefficients _MATH_ in _REF_ satisfies the non-linear recurrence relation _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_.
The key requirement is than that at each instant _MATH_ the triplet _MATH_ realizes a minimum of the global energy with _MATH_ an admissible crack with the geometrical properties described above and the pair _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
This (axiomatic) requirement of global stability is the adaptation to the case of complex bodies of the analogous requirement formulated in [FM] for simple bodies.
Hence, the design of both sliding mode controller and sliding surface are now converted into a problem of finding a global solution of the following minimization problem _MATHDISP_
In this section we use the theory of large deviations to further substantiate our educated guess about the type of asymptotic behavior for the second queue content. 
Indeed we find that the singularities found in the previous section determine the decay, again depending on whether or not the criterion in (_REF_) holds. 
Moreover, the current approach yields insight in the interpretation of the two different outcomes.
In this subsection we complete the proof of Theorem _REF_ in the _MATH_ case (_MATH_). 
As a preparation, we need further auxiliary statements. 
Recall that concerning _MATH_, we assume that it has polynomial exactness of order _MATH_ with shift _MATH_, i.e., for any polynomial _MATH_ of degree _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_, and that _MATH_. 
The first lemma is the counterpart of the statement of _CITE_ for general _MATH_, with slightly modified proof. 
We note that similar estimates for the commutator _MATH_ have recently appeared a lot, and have contributed to the formulation and the proof of proximity conditions (see _CITE_ for a survey of proximity conditions and their use in the analysis of manifold-valued subdivision). 
For given _MATH_ with _MATH_, let _MATH_, and assume that _MATH_ is _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
Then for any finite sequence _MATH_ and any index _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is well-defined we have _MATHDISP_, where the constant _MATH_ is independent of the sequence _MATH_ and _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Proof. 
Let _MATH_, and _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We have _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
Note that for arbitrary _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, and by induction _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ for any polynomial _MATH_ of degree _MATH_. 
These properties will be used without further mentioning.
MSPC refers to a collection of algorithms that can be used to extract information from large multivariable data sets, which are more and more frequently recorded in the process industry. 
Although the algorithms differ considerably, they have one feature in common: they identify several artificial variables, as linear or non-linear combinations of the original variables, with the aim of obtaining a reduced set of statistically uncorrelated variables. 
The reduced variable set is then utilised to determine some statistics and bivariate scatter diagrams for online process monitoring. 
Over the last two decades, a host of MSPC techniques has been developed and successfully applied in many studies. 
Two prominent MSPC methods are the principal component analysis (PCA) and the partial least squares (PLS). 
These two algorithms are reviewed briefly in the following sections. 
More details on PCA and PLS can be find, e.g. by Jackson (1991) and Geladi and Kowalski (1986), respectively.
We exploit firm-level information for the computation of forward-looking effective tax rates by assuming that the hypothetical investment is identical to the existing investment and financing structure of a firm. 
Applying this framework, we compute forward-looking effective (marginal and average) tax rates for a sample of 652,337 firms as compiled in Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS data-base. 
The analysis turns out very insightful. 
For instance, we find that the country-specific element in these rates is relatively large for effective average tax rates (which are relevant for discrete/lumpy investment decisions) but relatively small for effective marginal tax rates (i.e., for investment decisions at the intensive margin). 
For the latter, firm-specific effects and, to a lesser extent, industry-specific effects are relatively important.
Estimating the critical speeds and the mode shapes of the rotordynamic system between zero and 125% of the MCOS is generally the first step in the lateral analysis. 
The critical speeds of the rotor/support system are estimated from the undamped critical speed map, superimposed by the calculated system support stiffness in the horizontal direction (_MATH_) and the vertical direction (_MATH_) as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
A quick estimate of a particular critical speed can be found from the figure at the intersection of the corresponding curve in the critical speed map and the bearing stiffness curve. 
The actual locations of the critical speeds of the system below the MCOS should be validated in a test stand as required by the API standard _CITE_. 
Mode shape plots for the relevant critical speeds should also be included in this initial analysis.
The graded Betti numbers _MATH_ of _MATH_ encode the ranks of the syzygy modules in a minimal free resolution of its coordinate ring _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
Recall that _MATH_ are the total Betti numbers. 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_ are understood from the context, we simply write _MATH_ for the graded Betti numbers. 
We can also grade _MATH_ by _MATH_ instead of _MATH_ by setting _MATH_ to the _MATH_-th standard unit vector in _MATH_. 
Then the summands of the _MATH_ syzygy module have the form _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
We call _MATH_ a multidegree and _MATH_ a multigraded Betti number. 
Typically, we summarize this numerical data in a standard Macaulay2 _CITE_ Betti diagram, a table whose _MATH_-th entry is _MATH_.
This is the notation used in Example _REF_, where, in the interest of readability, we use _MATH_ in place of 0.
Let _MATH_ denote a vector of dichotomous item response for the _MATH_ examinee: _MATH_. 
His or her mastery status _MATH_ accounts for the pattern of _MATH_ mostly. 
To make it more practical, the DINA model also allows for "slipping" and "guessing". 
Here slips and guesses are modeled at the item level. 
Parameter _MATH_ indicates the probability of slipping on the _MATH_ item when an examinee has mastered all the attributes it requires. 
Parameter _MATH_ denotes the probability of correctly answering the _MATH_ item when an examinee does not master all the required attributes.
One can tailor this _MATH_ to a designer's wish by just mixing different relaxation time _MATH_ cell, which follow for example a Fibonacci sequence (this remains to be examined in a future publication) or another sequence. 
In Figs. _REF_ and _REF_, _MATH_ sec, _MATH_. 
Notice that _MATH_ tends to a specific number which is beyond the scope of this paper to calculate and we reserve for a future calculation.
It remains to give the lower bound for the function _MATH_ defined in Theorem _REF_. 
Since the Jacobian of the mapping _MATH_ is equal to _MATH_, we must estimate the integral _MATHDISP_ from below, provided _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is nondecreasing, the integral (_REF_) attains its minimum value at the set _MATH_. 
Therefore, _MATHDISP_. 
Thus _MATHDISP_. 
Applying Theorem _REF_ to the last inequality we obtain the left-hand side of (_REF_). 
The proof is complete.
3) Dark photospheric lanes become longer and we detect the corresponding bipole's footpoints in circular polarization. 
Magnetic field presumably strengthens through convective collapse, e.g. _CITE_. 
Previous to the first appearance of circular polarization signals, there must be a patch of linear polarization above a granular cell, as detected by _CITE_, that unfortunately we cannot discern due to the lack of corresponding data.
Following Drury (1983) the argument runs as follows: 
We consider a population of particles of mass _MATH_, velocity _MATH_, and momentum _MATH_, injected near the shock, that get scattered back and forth, and occasionally some particle gets lost from the system. 
This means we have to follow the momentum gains, and the probability that particles get lost.
Since we know that _MATH_ is Lipschitz, there must exist a constant _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ Further, if we use lemma 3.4 in _CITE_, we see that _MATHDISP_, for some constant _MATH_. 
Using these results and the fact that all of the parameters are bounded, we can deduce that there exists a constant _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_
Equation (_REF_) is a balance of interactions that governs the evolution of bulk defects. 
Actually a driving force is absent because evolving bulk defects are not considered here. 
Such a force (of dissipative nature) will appear later along the tip of the crack. 
For this reason, equation (_REF_) represents for smooth fields only an alternative way of writing the balance of interactions. 
In fact it can be obtained only by pulling the balance equations of standard and substructural actions back in the reference place. 
Inhomogeneity in the material is accounted for by the term _MATH_. 
In absence of inertia effects and dissipative actions, at equilibrium, it is possible to show that the version (_REF_) free of inertial terms is the sole balance naturally available on _MATH_ (by means of horizontal variations) when one considers irregular minimizers of the elastic energy, minimizers that are elements of some Sobolev space. 
The reason is that Sobolev maps may not have tangential derivatives (see further comments and pertinent proofs in [MM]). 
In addition, the balance (_REF_) assumes a subtle independent physical meaning when defects (in the sense of inhomogeneities of various nature) evolve relatively to the surrounding material. 
Note that the conservative part of the microstress _MATH_ appears in (_REF_) (in particular, in the expression of _MATH_), moreover, if one considers a dissipative part of _MATH_, it would also affect the expression of _MATH_. 
In contrast, the conservative part of the self force, namely _MATH_, does not appear in (_REF_), while its dissipative part _MATH_ furnishes a bulk contribution to the evolution of defects, namely _MATH_.
In quantum field theory there are well known conditions of local causality (local commutativity and Bogolyubov's causality). 
However, even for classical systems, the notions of chance and probability are not well consistent with the notion of causality which is formulated in space-time.
Stratospheric balloon-borne telescopes have two fundamental advantages over ground based telescopes: they permit UV observations and they provide a seeing-free image quality over the full field of view (FoV). 
However, pointing to the Sun and tracking a feature on the solar surface is a formidable task, especially for a telescope hanging under a balloon that is driven by stratospheric winds at an altitude of 36 km. 
In addition to the apparent (diurnal and seasonal) motion of the Sun, there is a number of oscillatory modes that may be induced by variable winds in the stratosphere, and taken up by the balloon-gondola system. 
The tip-tilt correction of CWS was built with a range of _MATH_ 45 arcsec, and a closed-loop bandwidth of 60 Hz (6 db attenuation of tip-tilt). 
The instrument worked reliable throughout the flight. 
Closed-loop operations were possible, whenever the gondola pointing was within the angular range of the CWS tip-tilt mirror.
The reference place _MATH_ is assumed without crack. 
When a crack occurs in the current place of the body, the placement map _MATH_ is pointwise one-to-one except at a surface _MATH_ in _MATH_, with _MATH_ a function considered smooth here for the sake of simplicity. 
The intersection of _MATH_ with the boundary of _MATH_ is a regular curve _MATH_ endowed with unit normal _MATH_ belonging to the tangent plane of _MATH_ at each _MATH_. 
For any part _MATH_ of _MATH_ intersecting _MATH_, the curve _MATH_ is also regular and the normal to it in the plane tangent to _MATH_ at _MATH_ is also indicated by _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ is the normal to _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
The surface gradient of the normal vector field, namely _MATH_, is the curvature tensor, its trace is the negative of the overall curvature _MATH_; by definition _MATH_, _MATH_ the second order unit tensor.
MLN (Manage Large Networks) is an open source tool designed for management of large numbers of virtual machines. 
A concept of groups of virtual machines called "projects", enable atomic management operations such as building, starting and stopping entire clusters and networks. An expandable plugin framework to allow additions to MLNs configuration language and features._CITE_
Assume _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
Then there exists a unique solution _MATH_ to problem (_REF_) and _MATHDISP_ with the maximal existence time _MATH_. 
Firstly, we study the differential equation _MATHDISP_.
The upper limits on the cross sections for the heavy scalar Higgs boson are: _MATHDISP_. 
The cross sections associated with the loop-induced _MATH_ decays, _MATH_, become maximal simultaneously with the cross sections _MATH_, i.e. for the parameters _REF_. 
For the cross sections _MATH_ the relevant parameters are _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The maximal values are reached for _MATHDISP_. 
This can be understood as follows: the couplings of _MATH_ to up-type quarks are proportional to _MATH_ while its couplings to down-type quarks are proportional _MATH_. 
Therefore, for reasons analogous to those discussed for the _MATH_ production cross sections, the largest _MATH_ production rates are obtained for large _MATH_, i.e. for an enhanced _MATH_ coupling. 
This coupling is increased further if the mixing angle _MATH_ is small. 
However, the (tree-level) partial widths for _MATH_ are proportional to _MATH_ and would be suppressed for large _MATH_ and a small _MATH_. 
In the search for the largest cross sections _MATH_, the best compromise turns out to be the choice _MATH_. 
Within the region of _MATH_ values allowed by direct Higgs-boson searches, the _MATH_ cross sections steadily increase for decreasing _MATH_, i.e., the largest cross sections are obtained for relatively small _MATH_. 
Finally the mass _MATH_ of the light Higgs boson must be large enough so that the competing _MATH_ decay mode is kinematically forbidden. 
The masses of the fourth generation fermions have very little influence on the _MATH_ cross sections in this scenario, as long as they are in agreement with the mass bounds _REF_ and the constraints on _MATH_ and _MATH_.
As mentioned in the previous section, the _MATH_ by _MATH_ transfer matrix of the blocked nonuniform transmultiplexer, _MATH_, is given by postmultiplying the transfer matrix of the blocked representation of the synthesis part _MATH_, by that of the analysis part, _MATH_, i.e., _MATHDISP_. 
The desired transmultiplexer is a system that has a transfer function close to a pure delay from the input to the output of each channel, and zero leakage between different channels. 
Since blocking is norm-preserving, we may compare the blocked transfer matrix of the transmultiplexer, with a transfer matrix _MATH_, which corresponds to a proper blocking of a zero transfer function from the inputs to the outputs of different channels, and a pure delay _MATH_, from the input to the output of channels _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
If the desired delay for the _MATH_-th channel is _MATH_ samples, the _MATH_ blocked transfer matrix of the channel, _MATH_, can be obtained by writing _MATH_, with _MATH_, as _MATHDISP_. 
The _MATH_ blocked transfer matrix of the nonuniform transmultiplexer is _MATHDISP_. 
Using state-space representations for transfer matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, we can formulate the model-matching design of transmultiplexers as discussed in _CITE_.
Substituting (_REF_) in (_REF_) and taking into account (_REF_), gives _MATHDISP_
We consider a triplet _MATH_. 
The operator _MATH_ associated with the form and its part _MATH_ in _MATH_ are defined and are sectorial operators of _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
These operators _MATH_ and _MATH_ are regarded as realizations of the elliptic operator _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, under the Dirichlet boundary conditions _MATH_ on _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the trace operator defined by _MATH_.
Let _MATH_, where _MATH_'s are coefficients to control the weight of each term (see _CITE_). 
This case was designed to obtain a separation phenomenon. 
If one adds an extra advection term _MATH_, the second equation of (_REF_) turns into _MATHDISP_. 
The first term _MATH_ is Fick's diffusion and the second term _MATH_ is self-diffusion. 
The third term _MATH_ is cross diffusion and one may compare the coefficient "_MATH_" with "_MATH_ " in (_REF_). 
The fourth term is advection that may give _MATH_ a fitness to the resource distribution and the coefficient "_MATH_" corresponds to "_MATH_".
This chapter showcases a comprehensive case study detailing the development of a SHM system for a composite rotor. 
It is clear that the development requires a knowledge of the system under consideration as well as a knowledge of the genetic fuzzy system [13 -16]. 
This multidisciplinary nature is typical of realistic SHM problems.
Next we relate the payoff _MATH_ of a proportional maximal configuration _MATH_ with the equity core associated to _MATH_. 
This is an interesting result since it is just one of the requirements over a configuration to be a regular configuration.
(ii) _MATH_; (iii) _MATH_ ( conjugation by _MATH_) is an action of _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
The element _MATH_ is said to be a conjugate of _MATH_; (iv) If _MATH_ is a normal subgroup of _MATH_, then _MATH_ is an action of _MATH_ on _MATH_, where the right hand multiplication is the group multiplication.
When short laser pulse is absorbed by SHs, the energy is transferred to the electron gas. 
Energy transfer from electrons to the lattice occurs at much larger time scales due a large difference in the masses of electrons and positive ions. 
It is, therefore, possible to introduce distinct temperatures _MATH_ and _MATH_ for the electron and the ion (lattice) subsystems. 
We then can write the following equations for _MATH_ and _MATH_ _CITE_ _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ are the electronic and the lattice subsystems heat capacities, respectively, _MATH_ is the rate of energy exchange between the subsystems and _MATH_ is the bisphere volume (_MATH_ is the volume of single particle). 
The following numerical values are given in Ref. _CITE_: _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The term _MATH_ accounts for the energy gain by the electronic subsystem (per unit volume) due to absorption of the laser radiation and _MATH_ describes the heat loss due to heat diffusion. 
To find _MATH_, we will use the following simple model. 
We assume that heat loss per unit volume is _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the surface of a particle and _MATH_ is the heat conductivity of water, _MATH_ is the unit normal to the particle surface, _MATH_ is the temperature of surrounding medium (assumed _MATH_ at the particle surface to be equal to _MATH_.)
For a chosen value of _MATH_, we first compute the initial conditions _MATH_ for numerical integration by evaluating Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_) at _MATH_. 
We then integrate Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_) with these initial conditions and error tolerances of _MATH_ in Matlab's function "ode45". 
We plot the norm of the numerical solution, _MATH_, for various _MATH_ values, against time in Fig. (_REF_). 
For _MATH_ close to the homoclinic point value, the computed solution returns close to the origin. 
As depicted in Fig. (_REF_), we find _MATH_ is a good estimate of the homoclinic point (the last digit may be unreliable). 
For _MATH_, in contrast, the trajectory goes more quickly to one of the two fixed points.
For each _MATH_ we define the functions _MATH_ with _MATH_ as trivial continuation of the self-similar profiles constructed in Section _REF_. 
This means we set _MATH_ for _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
We also denote the corresponding coupling weights by _MATH_ and use notations such as _MATH_ and _MATH_ to refer to the various moments of _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ denote the position vector of point _MATH_ relative to the handle _MATH_ (Fig _REF_). 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the linear and angular velocity of a differential element at point _MATH_ on body _MATH_ in the Newtonian frame _MATH_, with _MATH_ referring to handles _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
Henceforth, unless mentioned otherwise, all the kinematic quantities are assumed to be in the Newtonian frame. 
The expression for spatial velocity of point _MATH_ (_MATH_) can be written as _MATHDISP_.
Our model for animal density incorporates both covariate effects and unobserved spatial variation. 
In this paper we use only one covariate, but including more explanatory variables, possibly also intervening with different parametric forms from the one assumed here, would be relatively straightforward and imply only minor changes to our MCMC algorithm. 
Results from the current model, in particular analysis of the residual variation component, can help identify changes to the covariate setting. 
Our model for unobserved spatial variation is based on a mixture of smooth kernels with Gamma distributed weights, which is essentially the same model used in Waagepetersen and Schweder (2006). 
Alternatively, modelling tools such as log-Gaussian Cox processes (Mo ller, Syversveen, and Waagepetersen 1998) or Bayesian partition models based on step-wise constant functions (Heikkinen and Arjas 1998; Ferreira, Denison, and Holmes 2002) could have been considered.
The topic of electromagnetic metamaterials is a rich field that spans thousands of years and frequencies ranging from radio through the ultraviolet. 
These materials have a vast range of applications including art and jewelry, church decoration, frequency converters, electromagnetic cloaks, and sub-wavelength super lenses; just to name a few. 
Every day the field is expanding in new and different directions and the range of new technologies being created seems limited only by the creativity of those involved. 
By combining our understanding of materials behavior with our unprecedented ability to model and fabricate structures at the nanoscale, researchers are bringing devices into the world that were previously only seen in the movies.
Techniques aimed at designing Generalised Sampling Filters to assign stochastic sampling zeros.
The trivial implications (dashed arrows) from _REF_ should be clear from the defnitions. 
Briefly, _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ implies _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ because if the probability that _MATH_ is zero then the winning conditions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are equivalent. 
The reason for _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ implying _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ is analogous. 
_MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ implies _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ because the winning condition of the latter is more stringent than that of the former. 
_MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ implies _MATH_-_MATH_-_MATH_ because _MATH_.
If _MATH_ then _MATH_ would be the only optimal solution to (KP). 
Indeed, any other feasible solution _MATH_ has _MATH_ for some _MATH_ and _MATH_ for some _MATH_, which would mean _MATH_, and by lemma _REF_ _MATH_ would not be optimal. 
This contradicts the hypothesis that (KP) admits more than one optimal solution.
the heights of the boundary vertices are 0, i.e. in a prism that contains a boundary edge _MATH_ this edge is shared by the upper and the lower base;
This _MATH_ determines the _MATH_ in terms of _MATH_, equation (4.9) has at most a finite number of real roots, which ensures that there are only finitely many "gates" for the roots to cross the imaginary axis for any given _MATH_.
Moreover, the sampling time is taken as _MATH_ s which is reachable by the acquisition system. 
Consequently, for each signal, _MATH_ data are collected at _MATH_ from _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
This sampling time allows to settle the highest input signal frequency. 
A pseudo-random-binary-sequence, prbs, with a magnitude of 0 to 60 _MATH_ and a total duration of 10 s, is chosen as input flux density. 
It is composed of 9 D flip-flops and its smallest slot lasts 0.01 s so as to excite frequencies in the range _MATH_ rad.s_MATH_. 
The temperature is measured at the thermocouple position, i.e. at a distance _MATH_ from the excited surface _MATH_. 
Two sets of data are collected, one for system identification and the other for model validation.
While the matrix _MATH_ shown above was constructed based on the various possibilities for _MATH_ enumerated in Fig. _REF_, we could instead formulate _MATH_ using a spatial grid of microtubule binding sites like that shown in Fig. _REF_, where we assume that the front head is located at binding site 0 at the beginning of a cycle. 
In this scheme the binding site for the detached head determines _MATH_ and _MATH_.
This is once again an immediate consequence of Thm. _REF_ since a matrix with two opposite rows is clearly singular.
We insert a perturbed solution _MATH_ into Eq. (1), where _MATH_, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote unstaggered and staggered perturbations, respectively, and obtain the following difference-differential equations for small perturbations: _MATHDISP_. 
By adopting the complex perturbation form from Ref. _CITE_: _MATH_, in which _MATH_ are constants, _MATH_ is period of NWA while _MATH_ and _MATH_ are parameters of a modulated wave, we obtain the following dispersion relation: _MATHDISP_. 
Instability occurs when _MATH_, from which one may deduce that the modulationally unstable region is bounded from both below and above: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_.
The application range where all these listed radio technologies can be utilised is numerous, and the WBAN is only one option. 
For example, IEEE 802.11 family is more directed towards wireless local area or personal area networks (WLAN and WPAN, respectively) than WBAN, but still it can be used as a link from WBAN access point to room access point, and therefore it can be part of a personal wearable node. 
However, combining WLAN radio into the WBAN system typically increases the number of radios used in the system, which directly reflects to the implementation complexity and signal processing needs. 
Currently there are no explicit standard for WBAN but in November 2007 IEEE established a study group IEEE 802.15.6 to define one. 
During the March 2010, the IEEE802.15.6 successfully managed to merge all the proposals into one, which is a positive sign for the future WBAN technological development _CITE_. 
As pointed out in _CITE_, there are still several open questions for WBAN research, such as which radio technology utilises in most efficient way the radio channel, or selection of the frequency range in the penetration depth point of view for in-body communication. 
Distinctive of the WBAN communication is a data rate demand which is not targeting to those ones needed to transfer, e.g., high definition television signal. 
For peer-to-peer WBAN data links, it is sufficient to transfer rather small amount of data, and the data rate is more around hundreds of kilobits than megabits per second. 
The coming IEEE 802.15.6 standard still defines the required data rate between _MATH_ kb/s and _MATH_ Mb/s _CITE_. 
However, the total network traffic is a cumulative sum of the traffic in independent links. 
According to the same standard, the 10 kb/s minimum data rate should be supported between two BAN nodes within a range up to 3 m with packet error rate (PER) less than or equal to _MATH_% for _MATH_ octet payload with a link success probability of _MATH_% with all the channels defined by the standard document _CITE_. 
WBAN traffic can be divided in different ways. 
For example in _CITE_, depending on the final application, WBAN operation is based on three different communication categories: streaming with a continuous data flow and a constant bandwidth; monitoring with periodic data; and alarm, when a communication is done only when necessary. 
The streaming type communication conveys data from a source to a destination or multiple targets. 
Applications are mainly related to entertainment and data upload/download operations. 
The measured data in a monitoring category can be reported further based on pre-defined scheduling, on event based decisions or the transmission can be continuous. 
Typically data rates are smaller than in the streaming case. 
Mutual property for these two applications is a need for reliable communication between the source and destination, the delay is not so critical. 
However, the alarm type transmission typically reports critical changes in the measured parameter, and therefore the transmission delay has more importance, as well as the data amounts to be transferred are quite small _CITE_.
We can now summarize the above results: given a matrix _MATH_, there exists a unique matrix _MATH_ by lemma _REF_. 
If _MATH_ is not positive semi-definite, lemma _REF_ states that by subtracting _MATH_ from its diagonal elements, we obtain a positive semi-definite _MATH_. 
Returning to (_REF_) with our fixed matrix _MATH_, such a diagonal shift of _MATH_ corresponds to an off-diagonal shift of the dissimilarities _MATHDISP_. 
In other words, if we were given _MATH_ instead of our original _MATH_, then _MATH_ would be a positive semi-definite member of the equivalence class _MATH_ of matrices fulfilling the decomposition _MATH_. 
Theorem _REF_ then tells us that this off-diagonally shifted matrix _MATH_ derives from a squared Euclidean distance. 
Since every positive semi-definite matrix is a dot product- (or gram-) matrix in some vector space, there exists a matrix _MATH_ of vectors such that _MATH_. 
The matrix _MATH_ then contains squared Euclidean distances between these vectors. 
We can now insert _MATH_ into our clustering procedure (which is assumed shift-invariant), and we will obtain the same partition of the objects as if we had clustered the original matrix _MATH_. 
Contrary to directly using _MATH_, however, the matrix _MATH_ now contains squared Euclidean distances between a set of vectors _MATH_. 
The vectors themselves can be reconstructed by way of kernel PCA, see _CITE_.
In Section 2 the model employed and the simulation procedure are briefly described. 
In Section 3 we present the results, first considering a planar geometry, so that the outcome can be compared with the analytical results, and then switching to a cylindrical geometry, which is more closely related to a coronal-arcade eruption or a coronal-loop expansion. 
In Section 4 we discuss the results and compare them with observations.
The dependence of the size of a chain also apparent in Fig. 9, where the MSF is plotted in the plan _MATH_ for the open-ended chain. 
It appears that, analogously to the results reported in Fig. 2, as the size of a chain increases, the domain of stable synchronization reduces more quickly than in the case of the closed end model, see Table 4.
We address now the rest of the cases, when there is at least one function _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Assume that _MATH_ if _MATH_, and _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
We have _MATHDISP_. 
In view of _REF_, we only need to work on the measure of the set _MATH_. 
Denoting by _MATH_ the center of _MATH_, we will show that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ is a constant independent of _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Assuming that _REF_ holds, Chebychev's and Holder inequality yield _MATHDISP_. 
We now estimate each of the above integrals by using polar coordinates. _MATHDISP_. 
We thus obtain _MATH_, and the theorem is then proved. 
We will now proceed to prove _REF_. 
In what follows _MATH_.
Representative TEM image of as-prepared silver chloride nanoparticles SFF is shown in Fig. 7. 
It reveals that silver chloride crystal show themselves as the cubes with the edge of about 200 nm. 
The SAED pattern reveals that the cube is single crystalline in nature and the spots could be indexed as the fcc structure of crystalline silver chloride, which is consistent with the XRD results. 
As-prepared silver chloride could be stabilized on SFF over long periods of time due to the synergistic interactions resulted from the typical meeting of the nanoparticles and biomolecules at the nanometer scale.
Let _MATH_. 
The group _MATH_ acts on _MATH_ by permutation of its coordinates and on _MATH_ matrices by simultaneously permuting rows and columns. 
Let _MATH_ be an optimal solution of the dual of the semidefinite relaxation and define _MATH_. 
The point _MATH_ is feasible since _MATHDISP_ and also optimal since _MATHDISP_. 
By transitivity of the action of _MATH_ the coordinates of _MATH_ are identical with constant value _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ it follows that _MATH_. 
As a result _MATHDISP_ and by optimality _MATH_. 
Evaluating the right hand side we obtain claim (_REF_). 
Next assume _MATH_ is a graph and the action of _MATH_ is doubly transitive. 
It follows that there are only two orbits for the action of _MATH_ on pairs of distinct vertices depending on whether or not the vertices are adjacent. 
Let _MATH_ be an optimal solution for the semidefinite relaxation of maxcut and note that, as before the average _MATH_ is an optimal feasible solution. 
The _MATH_ component of the average _MATH_ is given by _MATH_ and thus can assume only two values depending on whether vertices _MATH_ and _MATH_ are adjacent. 
Computing the objective function of the semidefinite relaxation we have _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the number of edges of _MATH_. 
Since there is no duality gap, by part (_REF_) we have _MATHDISP_ where the last equality follows from _MATH_ since 2-transitive graphs are regular. 
This establishes claim (_REF_). 
Let _MATH_ be an embedding obtained from the Cholesky factorization of _MATH_. 
The expected weight of a random hyperplane cut obtained from _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_ and claim (_REF_) follows. 
For nonnegative integers _MATH_, let _MATH_ be a graph whose vertices are the sets _MATH_, two of them adjacent iff they intersect in a set of size _MATH_. 
It is easy to see that the action of the permutation group on these graphs is doubly transitive. 
The spectra of this graphs was computed by Knuth _CITE_ and the above result simplifies the proof of a theorem of Karloff _CITE_ showing that, for the set _MATH_ of all graphs _MATH_ we have the equality _MATH_. 
In particular, even for doubly transitive graphs the worst-case performance of the GW algorithm is equal to its theoretical lower bound. 
If the automorphism group _MATH_ of a graph _MATH_ has rank three (i.e. if there are exactly three orbits of _MATH_ on _MATH_, namely equal, adjacent and nonadajcent pairs) then _MATH_ is two-transitive and in fact _MATH_ is a strongly regular graph so in particular its spectrum has only three values simplifying the computation of the performance ratio (see Theorem _REF_ for details).
It is obvious that, by setting _MATH_, in the relations _REF_ and using the relation _REF_ for inverse of the Laplace transform _MATH_, the inverse of the Laplace transform _MATH_ can be presented by _MATHDISP_.
Our phirotopes (analogues of determinants) are the same as those studied previously by Below, Krummeck, and Richter-Gebert _CITE_ and Delucchi _CITE_.
Capacitated lot sizing models cope with setup times in two distinguished manners, big or small buckets, depending upon the time length of a period, see Drexl and Kimms _CITE_ and Pochet _CITE_. 
Big bucket models are characterized by large time periods, typically weeks or months, allowing the production of several products per period. 
Setup times can be accurately treated if not sequence dependent. 
In this case setup activities can be introduced directly in the capacity constraints, since the sequence of manufacturing orders within a period does not affect capacity consumption due to setup. 
Small bucket models, on the other hand, are characterized by short time periods, shifts or days for instance, in which at most one setup is allowed per period. 
These models can deal with changeover setup times, at the expense of a restricted coverage of each time period.
The present paper addresses those questions. 
It does not prove new general results nor offer new models, but it does show how to extend dynamics (specifically, replicator and gradient dynamics) from games of complete information to games of incomplete information. 
In some cases the extensions continue to yield systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but in other cases they yield partial differential equations (PDEs), and the stability properties of these systems can be investigated analytically or numerically.
A much simpler proof can be obtained by directly producing a series solution to _REF_, _REF_, and _REF_. 
The key to solving this system in series is to use a basis different from the standard power series basis _MATH_. 
The difficulty with power series is due, in part, to the presence of _MATH_ in the denominators. 
Since the factor _MATH_ accumulates to powers of _MATH_ in the numerator and to _MATH_ in the denominator, a series expansion in the basis _MATHDISP_ is much more amenable to the system of _MATH_-difference equations than the basis _MATH_. 
Two important properties of this basis that are easily checked are: _MATHDISP_. 
We then set _MATHDISP_. 
The _MATH_-difference equations _REF_, _REF_, and _REF_ my be rewritten as _MATHDISP_. 
Substituting the series expansions _REF_-_REF_ and using _REF_ and _REF_ gives the system _MATHDISP_, with initial conditions _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Notice that _REF_ and _REF_ combine to give _MATHDISP_, from which we conjecture that _MATH_. 
Since this equation is valid for _MATH_ by the initial conditions, it follows by induction and Eq. _REF_ that _MATH_ holds for all _MATH_. 
This equality and _REF_ combine to turn _REF_ into an equation in _MATH_ alone: _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, by induction, we deduce that _MATHDISP_ holds for all _MATH_. 
The solution to this equation with the initial conditions _MATH_ and _MATH_ is given by: _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_. 
The solutions for _MATH_ and _MATH_ are then easily found to be _MATHDISP_. 
When these are substituted back into _REF_, _REF_, and _REF_ and routine simplifications are performed for _MATH_, the resulting expressions for the _MATH_ originally defined by _REF_ are: _MATHDISP_. 
The Rogers-Selberg identities _REF_-_REF_ then follow by setting _MATH_ and using _REF_.
The results in Section _REF_ show that the presence of suprathermal particles in the background corona causes both qualitative and quantitative modifications to type III emission processes. 
We found that for _MATH_-distributed coronal plasmas the beam-wave and wave-wave interactions in type III bursts take place primarily at large speeds for the beam electrons and so large phase speeds and small wavenumbers for the waves. 
In contrast, the regime of smaller phase speeds and larger wavenumbers is important for Maxwellian-distributed than _MATH_-distributed corona, as shown in our previous work for Maxwellian electron injections ( e.g., _CITE_, _CITE_) and demonstrated here in Section _REF_ for injected electrons with power-law spectra. 
This change in the parametric regimes for the beams and waves in type III sources causes faster type III beams and faster-drifting type III bursts in _MATH_-distributed than Maxwellian-distributed background plasmas. 
For example, the beam speed _MATH_ and _MATH_ for a _MATH_ background (S1) and the corresponding Maxwellian background (S3), respectively, for same injected electrons. 
Detailed studies further show that the drift rates _MATH_ of _MATH_ emission produced in a _MATH_-plasma agree quantitatively with Equation (_REF_), for an approximately constant _MATH_ that is consistent with the speeds and dynamics of the beam electrons predicted inside the source region.
In order to find this solution we consider following form of AdS_MATH_ metric _MATHDISP_ and consider the Wilson line that is siting at _MATH_. 
Our goal is to find Wilson line that for _MATH_ takes the form of circle with _MATH_. 
In order to find such a configuration we consider an ansatz _MATHDISP_. 
Then we easily obtain _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Then we obtain _MATHDISP_ so that DBI part of the action takes the form _MATHDISP_. 
Further, there is a coupling to _MATH_ field in the form _MATHDISP_. 
As in the case of straight Wilson line we start with the equation of motion for _MATH_ and we found that it is solved for _MATH_, or _MATH_ and we choose for our convenience _MATH_. 
Further the equation of motion for _MATH_ implies _MATHDISP_. 
Further, the equations of motion for _MATH_ imply a conserved electric flux _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ that allows us to find _MATHDISP_. 
Inserting the above results into the equation of motion for _MATH_ we again obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Note that in deriving the above, we have used the fact that _MATHDISP_. 
Finally we determine the equation of motion for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ 
Now we will argue that the ansatz _MATH_ solves the equation above. 
Indeed, using the fact that _MATH_ we one can check that the above equation is identically zero. 
Let us now evaluate the action for the D2-brane configuration on this solution _MATHDISP_. 
Further, we have the first boundary contribution at _MATH_. 
We again proceed as in previous section for the boundary contributions. 
Namely, we evaluate the contribution to the action for general _MATH_, then insert the ansatz _MATH_ and finally evaluated the action at _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
In the same way the boundary contribution from the gauge fields takes the form _MATHDISP_. 
Collecting all these terms together we obtain that the divergent terms cancel as in the case of straight Wilson line. 
On the other hand we find finite contribution to the action in the form _MATHDISP_, where we used the convention that _MATH_ and where _MATH_ is the fundamental string action evaluated on circular Wilson line. 
Borrowing the interpretation of Wilson lines in _MATH_ correspondence using D3-branes we can argue that our solution describes Wilson line in symmetric _MATH_ representation where _MATH_ is level of CS action. 
It would be certainly very interesting to study the problem whether there exists D-brane description of Wilson loops in arbitrary representations. 
We hope to return to these problems in future.
The GOES soft _MATH_-ray flare catalogue gives the overall flaring picture, considering the Sun as a whole. 
The beauty and power of the non-stationary Poisson model in the potential ability to represent the global solar flare dynamics as consisting of rather mathematically simple constituents-exponentials. 
Presumably, the different active regions (or even smaller regions) may contribute to the global flaring with notably different rates and thus appear at the limit as a power-law-like distribution. 
However, the individual active regions have very poor statistics (about hundred events at most) and a series of assumptions should be made a priori (_CITE_). 
In addition, _CITE_ reported a piece-wise constant Poisson fit for the active region, which gives motivation to consider even smaller flaring areas to be an "elementary piece" in the mechanism just speculated above.
If there exist functions _MATH_, _MATH_ and a constant _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for all _MATH_, then (_REF_) in conjunction with (_REF_) and the fact that _MATH_ for all _MATH_ imply the following estimate: _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_. 
Estimate (_REF_) in conjunction with the BIC property imply that _MATH_. 
Moreover, (_REF_) and Definition 1.4 show that system (_REF_) is RFC from the input _MATH_, since we have for all _MATH_ _MATHDISP_
From the proof of Theorem _REF_ it follows that estimates _REF_, _REF_ are the best possible: if non-negative numbers _MATH_, _MATH_ satisfy _REF_or _REF_, then equality holds in condition _REF_or _REF_ for a unique solution _MATH_ of problem _REF_-_REF_ for some linear positive operators _MATH_, _MATH_ with norms _MATH_, _MATH_ and for some function _MATH_, _MATH_.
We can also easily show that at _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Using this result along with the kinematic equation for bivectors, (_REF_), as well as the fact that for a given interval we can set _MATH_, we can show that, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ noting that for bivectors _MATH_. 
Using a Taylor expansion, we can write the rotation bivector over two intervals as, _MATHDISP_
F-Measure: measures again the accuracy of the cluster, but it allows to penalize differently false negatives and false positives, by varying a parameter _MATH_. 
F-Measure is aggregate quality measure of precision and recall, already introduced in Chap. 
_REF_: _MATHDISP_ where P is the precision and R is the recall.
Studying the heat flow carried by Kappa distributions in the solar corona, _CITE_ demonstrated that a weak power-law tail in the electron VDF can allow heat to flow up a radially directed temperature gradient. 
This result was also confirmed by _CITE_ who obtained the heat flux versus _MATH_ in a slab of the solar corona from a kinetic simulation taking collisions into account. 
For _MATH_, the flux is close to the Spitzer-Harm classical collisional values while for smaller values of _MATH_, the heat flux strongly increases and changes of sign! 
If _MATH_ is small enough, the fast wind can be suprathermally driven _CITE_. 
This shows the inadequacy of the classical heat conduction law in space plasmas and the importance to deal with non-Maxwellian velocity distribution such as Kappa VDF (_CITE_, _CITE_).
We introduce a class of estimators for the third order parameter in extreme value statistics when the distribution function underlying the data is heavy tailed. 
For appropriately chosen intermediate sequences of upper order statistics, consistency is established under the third order tail condition and asymptotic normality under the fourth order tail condition. 
Simulation experiments illustrate the finite sample behavior of some selected estimators.
Note that the longest length of a cycle is 4. 
No more calculation is necessary. 
Summarizing the above argument, one sees that the best sub-Nash equilibrium for cycle policies is of tolerance _MATH_. 
The corresponding sub-Nash solutions are _MATH_ and _MATH_.
According to equation (_REF_), _MATH_ is actually determined by the first job in _MATH_. 
Once the first job is set down, the makespan will not change however we re-order the other jobs. 
Therefore there are no more than _MATH_ different makespan values in the solution space, although there are a total of _MATH_ different schedules.
In the case of a congruence of timelike geodesics defined by the vector field _MATH_, the Raychaudhuri equation is given by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the Ricci tensor, the expansion parameter, the shear and the rotation associated with the congruence, respectively. 
While in the case of a congruence of null geodesics defined by the vector field _MATH_, the Raychaudhuri equation is given by _MATHDISP_.
Notice that Equation (12) reveals a network of thin current structures, with a filament-like configuration, during the late stages of the evolution. 
These current filaments are formed mainly within the central and the east side of the EFR. 
Their formation is due to the fact that the twisted field lines of the emerging field undergo a shear along height _CITE_ the innermost field lines that are closer to the initial tube's axis have an orientation parallel to the _MATH_-axis, while the outermost field lines are oriented mostly in parallel to the _MATH_-axis. 
This shear of the orientation of the emerging field lines is more pronounced when the initial twist is less. 
The outermost field lines are the first field lines that reconnect and change their connectivity. 
As emergence continues, new field lines are coming from below with a different relative orientation to the ambient field lines. 
Thus, layers with enhanced current density are formed when new emerging field lines come into contact with pre-existing field lines, leading to a complex system that consists of many current sheets with different orientations. 
Eventually, emission may take place along these current layers.
As explained before, once the shift and Wilson lines are specified, the spectrum of the model is fixed. 
The gauge group of the benchmark model is _MATHDISP_. 
The quantum numbers of the massless states w.r.t. _MATH_ are shown in table _REF_.
The FIFO queue can be used to calculate the occurrence frequencies _MATH_ of the two types of brood elements. 
For example, if _MATH_, and STM has the form depicted in Fig. _REF_, the occurrence frequencies of white and black brood elements are: _MATH_ (2/10), and _MATH_ (3/10).
When the intervals contain the complete simulator predictions, we gain confidence that we have accounted for missing information in the incomplete simulator within our reified simulators. 
For each general, structural, and both types of reification, the credible intervals contain _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ of the complete simulator outcomes respectively. 
We realize that these percentages are less than 95%, thus we remind the readers that full Bayesian credible intervals do not necessarily have traditional coverage properties. 
Additionally, the modeling process implemented in this paper enabled us to estimate simulator uncertainty that reflected, honestly, expert judgement. 
These estimates may still be inaccurate, but, because we captured some of the missing structure in _MATH_ (as shown by covering over 50% of the complete simulator predictions), subsequent analyses of _MATH_ would only improve if they included reification.
Notations: 
Throughout this paper unless specified we let _MATH_ be Euclidean norm, _MATH_ be an identity matrix of suitable dimensions. 
If _MATH_ is a vector or matrix, its transpose is denoted by _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ is a symmetric matrix, _MATH_ denotes its largest eigenvalue.
Consider the system _REF_, _REF_ with initial condition _REF_. 
The solution is _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is an arbitrary constant. 
Thus _MATHDISP_.
Imagine a picture of people swollen from hunger, dead and dying, and we, the teens aged thirteen-fourteen, were not only seeing this with our own eyes every day, but, in addition, were not eating as frequently, as we would have liked. 
However, our school lessons in social science were devoted to the advantages of the socialistic system and Soviet way of life. 
And after each phrase the teacher, addressing hungry children, used to inquire, "Are you kids truly filled up?" 
I had memorized these lessons for life. 
And until now, when I invite guests, after dinner I sometimes ask, "Are you kids truly filled up?"
Let us begin with part (i). 
Let _MATH_ with _MATH_, and set _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Observe first, that _MATH_. 
Indeed, since _MATH_, we have that _MATH_, and we can apply Lemma _REF_.
When the effects by the ground and the ionosphere are not considered, the potential functions for the primary field radiated by vertical electric dipole can be represented as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
In above equation, _MATH_ is written in the form _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
_MATH_ is the Legendre function of order _MATH_. 
The function _MATH_ can be expressed in terms of half-order Bessel function of the first kind, while the function _MATH_ is its corresponding outgoing first-kind Hankel function. 
They are defined as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
It is noted that the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ should satisfied the following differential equation: _MATHDISP_.
For the remainder of this appendix we restrict our attention to _MATH_-matrices. 
Let _MATH_ be a _MATH_-matrix with the corresponding system of equations: _MATHDISP_. 
An important role is played by the determinant of the matrix _MATH_. 
In the _MATH_-case it is defined as the cross product of the column vectors: _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_, the column vectors _MATH_ are linearly dependent (so-in _MATH_- multiples of each other), if and only if _MATH_. 
The following theorem characterises invertibility in the _MATH_-case completely.
The starting point of the design procedure for Table _REF_ is the input word size _MATH_ and binary point location _MATH_. 
Given the 2-pair _MATH_, we select the additional system word size parameters _MATH_ such that the system word size at _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
Therefore, the system word size for the adder inputs leading to _MATH_ (assuming error-free addition) is _MATH_ for quantizers _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
We choose the precisions of _MATH_ at _MATH_, assuming _MATH_ was large enough to generally prevent overflows at this summing point. 
The output of the ADC is assumed to be at quantizer _MATH_ at a smaller precision of _MATH_, which implies a sign extension before being submitted to the adder that computes the output at quantizer _MATH_. 
The output port quantizer _MATH_ is also fixed at the same precision of _MATH_, that is _MATH_. 
Assuming _MATH_ is large enough, we select _MATH_ and _MATH_ to be 1-bit smaller than _MATH_. 
Similarly, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are chosen to be 1-bit smaller than _MATH_. 
It follows that _MATH_ and _MATH_ need to be 1-bit smaller than _MATH_.
This limit is reached by increasing _MATH_ and decreasing _MATH_ while keeping _MATH_ fixed. 
Because we are taking the (dimensionless) acceleration to zero, in this limit we expect _MATH_ to be given by the result (_REF_) for a quark moving in a straight line with speed _MATH_, meaning that we expect that as _MATH_ at fixed _MATH_ we should find that _MATH_ for the rotating quark is given by (_REF_) with _MATHDISP_, meaning that holding _MATH_ fixed as we take the _MATH_ limit means holding _MATH_ fixed. 
The general result (_REF_) for _MATH_ together with the result from Section 2.3 that _MATH_ and therefore _MATH_ in the present limit constitute an analytic demonstration of (_REF_). 
In the second row of Fig. _REF_, we show the ratio of our numerically obtained results for _MATH_ for the rotating quark to _MATH_. 
We see that our _MATH_ is described well by that for a quark in linear motion when _MATH_ is small enough at _MATH_ and _MATH_, i.e. in the regime where _MATH_ is small. 
Surprisingly, we see in the panel with _MATH_ that once the dimensionless frequency is large enough, _MATH_ even at small _MATH_, where the dimensionless acceleration _MATH_ is small. 
So, the criterion for the validity of the linear drag approximation to our result for the energy loss of a rotating quark cannot be simply _MATH_.
In minimal weighted vertex cover, the edges of graph _MATH_ have weights and the aim is to find a vertex cover that has a total minimal weight. 
We will first show a sequential and then describe a greedy distributed algorithm for minimal weighted vertex cover.
An assembly station for a set of final products _MATH_ must be located at some point _MATH_ on the plane. 
Each unit of final product _MATH_ is assembled using quantities _MATH_ of components _MATH_; no assembly losses and/or costs are considered. 
The components _MATH_ may be obtained from production units at points _MATH_, having a supply capacity _MATH_, at unit acquiring prices _MATH_ and with transportation costs _MATH_ per unit of quantity and distance. 
At client point _MATH_ a demand should be met for quantity _MATH_ of final product _MATH_, which may be transported there at transport cost _MATH_ per unit of quantity and distance. 
Both the location _MATH_ of the assembly station, and the quantities of all components _MATH_ obtained from each production unit _MATH_ must be determined, so as to minimize the total cost of the operation of the supply chain. 
Total cost includes three parts: the cost of buying the needed components, the costs for transportation of all components from the chosen production units towards the assembly station, and of all final products from the assembly station to the clients. 
All transportation costs are assumed to be proportional to transported quantity and Euclidean distance between the endpoints (denoted by _MATH_).
The discrete constraint submanifold _MATH_ of _MATH_ is determined by the constraints: _MATHDISP_, We have that the system _MATH_ is not reversible. 
Note that the Lagrangian function _MATH_ is reversible. 
However, the constraint submanifold _MATH_ is not reversible.
In Table _REF_ the values of the maximum tip deflection, obtained by the non-linear beam element and superelement models, are compared with existing results. 
It can be concluded that they are quantitatively in good agreement.
(i) Determine a Cartesian coordinate system _MATH_ such that the _MATH_-axis is parallel to the common perpendicular of _MATH_ and _MATH_ and such that the _MATH_ and _MATH_-axes are parallel to the two bisector lines, in a plane perpendicular to the _MATH_-axis, of the projection of _MATH_ and _MATH_ onto that plane.
However the computation time is not enough to fully assess a collision detection algorithm. 
Often, the quality of the collision responses is another important factor. 
We will discuss this in more details in the next section.
The Lyapunov exponent _MATH_ that characterizes the solar dynamo cannot be derived from the _MATH_ timeseries of sunspot number. 
To derive _MATH_ for a dynamical system it is necessary to estimate how many dimensions are required to describe the system and characterize the rate of separation of initially close trajectories. 
_CITE_ describe such calculations for a variety of solar activity indices. 
They conclude that _MATH_ for the solar dynamo but it varied from stochastic during Solar Cycles 10-19 to chaotic for Solar Cycles 20-23 and may be now returning to stochastic.
Let _MATH_ be as given in Proposition _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ be a hypersurface in _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The _MATH_ current-valued map _MATHDISP_ extends as an holomorphic function to _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
Moreover, one has _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes any closed hypersurface in a neighborhhod of _MATH_ in _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_ and _MATH_, _MATH_ being the union of all components of _MATH_ whose intersection with _MATH_ does not lie entirely in _MATH_.
Interpolating an arbitrary topology mesh by a smooth surface plays important role in geometric modeling and computer graphics. 
In this paper we present an efficient new algorithm for constructing Catmull-Clark surface that interpolates a given mesh. 
The control mesh of the interpolating surface is obtained by one Catmull-Clark subdivision of the given mesh with modified geometric rule. 
Two methods, push-back operation based method, normal based method, are presented for the new geometric rule. 
The interpolation method has the following features: (1) Efficiency: we obtain a generalized cubic B-spline surface to interpolate any given mesh in a robust and simple manner. 
(2) Simplicity: we use only simple geometric rule to construct control mesh for the interpolating subdivision surface. 
(3) Locality: the perturbation of a given vertex only influence the surface shape near this vertex. 
(4) Freedom: for each edge and face, there is one degree of freedom to adjust the shape of the limit surface. 
These features make interpolation using Catmull-Clark surfaces very simple and thus make the method itself suitable for interactive free-from shape design.
One of the most useful methods for computing the required filter coefficients is resynthesis through linear predictive coding (LPC) _CITE_. 
With LPC, a filter that predicts the output from part of the input is designed to minimize the error _MATH_ in _MATHDISP_ Note that this is actually a recursive linear filter where _MATH_ is the output and _MATH_ is the input. 
That means that the original signal can be exactly resynthesized given the filter coefficients _MATH_ and the error signal _MATH_ (also called residual signal). 
The quantity to be minimized is the quadratic error _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the number of samples in the recorded input signal. 
With _MATH_, the optimal solution for the set of coefficients _MATH_, _MATH_, is given by _CITE_: _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ _MATH_ represents the correlation of the signal _MATH_ with a shifted version of itself by _MATH_ samples, defined as _MATHDISP_ 
Since _MATH_ is a Toeplitz matrix, its inverse can be computed with the split Levinson-Durbin algorithm _CITE_.
Critically, each of the _MATH_ behaviour classes is labelled as being either normal and abnormal according to the number of patterns within the class. 
This implies that the model initialises anomaly by rarity. 
More specifically,
Over the past decade, there has been renewed public and official concern about infectious disease as a major public health threat. 
Indeed, the concern has arisen against a background of some surprise. 
In the past quarter of a century we have encountered the emergence of Legionnaire's disease, Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, Ebola virus, human mad cow disease, the Nipah virus, West Nile fever and SARS, as well as resurgent adversaries such as tuberculosis, cholera, dengue fever and malaria _CITE_.
The effective potential as function of the _MATH_ and _MATH_, can be obtained from Eqs.(_REF_) and (_REF_), results to be _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_.
Since _MATH_ is independent of _MATH_, by Lemma _REF_, there are only two non-degenerate choices for the law of _MATH_. 
It is known that _REF_ does not hold for the Wishart law, see _CITE_, which excludes the law from Lemma _REF_(iii). 
Thus _MATH_ is the identity matrix multiplied by a Gamma random variable.
If _MATH_ is a complex circuit orientation of a matroid _MATH_ on _MATH_, then for all _MATH_
(1) _MATH_ is a complex circuit orientation of the matroid _MATH_, and
(2) _MATH_ is a complex circuit orientation of the matroid _MATH_.
If _MATH_ define _MATH_ to be the unique element in _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ if and only if _MATHDISP_
Remark Many prominent tempo-spatial models are constructed from an ordinary, partial or fractional differential equation by adding a noise term, for instance in the form of white noise, to the equation. 
The solution to the equation then being often representable as an integral with respect to the noise of the Green's function of the original deterministic differential equation (see _CITE_). 
Thus the solution is taking the form of an ambit process. 
For some examples with discussion, see Sections _REF_ and _REF_.
Films and microstructured scaffolds have been fabricated using direct laser writing out of different polymers: hybrid organic-inorganic ORMOCORE b59, acrylate-based AKRE23, novel organic-inorganic Zr containing hybrid SZ2080 and biodegradable PEG-DA-258. 
Adult myogenic stem cells were grown on these surfaces in vitro. 
Their adhesion, growth and viability test results suggest good potential applicability of the materials in biomedical practice. 
Pieces of these polymers were implanted in rat's paravertebral back tissue. 
Histological examination of the implants and surrounding tissue ex vivo after three weeks of implantation was conducted and results show the materials to be at least as biocompatible as surgical clips or sutures. 
The applied direct laser writing technique seems to offer good future prospects in polymeric 3D scaffold design for artificial tissue engineering with autologous stem cells.
Let us again compute the current _MATH_ which takes the form _MATHDISP_. 
Note that it is again proportional to the number of fundamental strings _MATH_.
The period doubling cascade ends up with the onset of spiking chaotic dynamics in the model around _MATH_. 
One way of knowing that the period doubling cascade is over and that the chaotic dynamics being observed in the mapping and in the model is due to other contributing factors is to identify homoclinic bifurcations which involve the fixed point initiating the cascade. 
The detection of homoclinic orbits of saddle periodic orbits in the phase space of even a 3D system is the state of the art. 
The use of the voltage mappings simplifies the search drastically as capitalizes on a particular property of the unimodal mapping _CITE_. 
Namely, such an orbit can be detected by following a finite number of forward iterates of the only critical point. 
This critical point makes the mapping non-invertible because some of the mapping points have two pre-images, i.e., one pre-image on each monotonic segments of the mapping graph. 
In restriction to the left (decreasing) segment of the mapping graph the unstable fixed point _MATH_ will be attracting for backward iterates of the critical point which converge exponentially fast to it as time increases. 
On other hand, since the fixed point is unstable, some finite forward iterates of the critical point can only jump onto the fixed point. 
This number defines the ordering number for the primary homoclinic orbit. 
The occurrence of a homoclinic orbit gives rise to the abundance of other homoclinics _CITE_. 
This phenomenon, known as a homoclinic explosion _CITE_, leads to deterministic chaotic dynamics in a system.
Havran et al _CITE_ performed a cross-validation of BTF measurement accuracy of this system by comparing the derived BRDF data (averaged BTF images) with BRDF data measured by the commercial Integra BRDF setup _CITE_ for the same group of four material samples.
In the fuzzy control theory, the multi-model approach for describing a given nonlinear system is known as a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. 
The formalism of the fuzzy set theory is useful when there exists a priori qualitative knowledge related to the operation of a given process in different regimes. 
This qualitative knowledge can then be formalized through the notion of fuzzy relation. 
For a particular choice of the operators entering in the definition of the fuzzy relation we can derive a multi-model in the form used in this chapter. 
The fuzzy interpretation of the multi-model approach based nonlinear control is covered in the book by Tanaka and Wang _CITE_.
How can one obtain a _MATH_ term of the right size? 
In the context of orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string, two solutions to the _MATH_ problem have been proposed, '300
UTF-8 is compliant to ISO/IEC 8859-1 and fully backward compatible to ASCII (and, additionally, non-ASCII UTF-8 characters are just ignored by legacy ASCII-based programs). 
Indeed, due to rule 1, UTF-8 represents values 0-127 (00_MATH_-7F_MATH_) using a single byte with the leftmost bit at 0, which is exactly the same representation as in ASCII (and hence an ASCII file and its UTF-8 counterpart are identical). 
As to ISO/IEC 8859-1, since it fully exploits 8 bits, it goes from 0 to 255 (00_MATH_-FF_MATH_). 
Its lower 128 characters are just as ASCII, and fall, as said, in the 1-byte representation, while its upper 128 characters (those extending ASCII, going from 128 to 255, i.e. 80_MATH_-FF_MATH_) fall in the 2-byte representation (080_MATH_-7FF_MATH_, or 128-2047), thus they will be represented as 110000xx 10xxxxxx.
[Dynamics Inside the Vortex-Bubble] 
The first and third frames of Figure _REF_ correspond to values of _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively. 
The dynamics inside the vortex-bubbles at these parameter values are illustrated in the first and third boxes in Figure 8 of _CITE_. 
Then inside the bubble shown in the first frame of Figure _REF_, the dynamics are dominated by a family of primary invariant tori, around which a family of secondary invariant tori are "braided'.
Also, we consider the optically thick advection dominated disks with radiation pressure and _MATH_. 
We find out that the new viscosity cannot disappear the thermal instability and these disks are thermally unstable yet. 
However, when we take a toroidal magnetic field, it is seen that the increasing magnetic field cause to thermal stability in disks. 
The results are similar to figure 11 and 12.
We close this section by giving the finite-dimensional counterpart of Theorem _REF_. 
Namely, the following corollary has already been stated in _CITE_ where a small gap appeared in the proof.
The theta functions of Jacobi are _MATHDISP_; where _MATH_. 
We remind reader the following well-known identity: _MATHDISP_.
As a result of the linear chromosome in the transformation, the master graph and adjacency graph have a path. 
To circularize this path, we add caps to the telomeres (unpaired extremities) in _MATH_. 
This results in a disequilibrium of adjacencies in the two genomes _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
To restore the balance, we add null chromosome _MATH_, containing the same caps added in _MATH_, to _MATH_, and close the path by adding connecting green lines to the null. 
The resulting augmented master graph can be seen in Fig. _REF_c.
Because in all relations (equations of motions, boundary conditions and ansatz) the sum of _MATH_ and _MATH_ derivatives is preserved and _MATH_ is odd we can conclude _MATHDISP_. 
The interpretation of these equations will be discussed at section _REF_. 
From (_REF_) follows _MATHDISP_, and the solutions of (_REF_) and (_REF_) are _MATHDISP_.
Step 3). 
The final step is to consider the cases _MATH_ and _MATH_ (since one or the other can be found in each of the 7 cases above) and show that this is in fact sufficient to prove the proposition.
_CITE_ and _CITE_ described the solar seismic events that they identified as the convective phenomena producing acoustic waves at the top of convection zone. 
The strong darkening in the intergranular lane and the subsequent fast downdraft that precede the generation of acoustic flux may represent the fraction of the convective background that is correlated with the mode, while the resulting outward acoustic wave should contribute to the intrinsic or natural correlated background for the resonant mode. 
A scenario for acoustic energy production compatible with the observation of seismic events appeared from the analysis of numerical simulations of solar surface convection (_CITE_).
Let _MATH_ be the length of the shortest path, starting at _MATH_, then visiting polygonal cuts _MATH_ in order, and finally ending at _MATH_, where _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ be the dimension of _MATH_. 
The probability (for the Fubini-Study volume defined above) that a pair _MATH_ belongs to a ball for the condition metric _MATH_ of radius _MATH_ centered at _MATH_ is at least _MATHDISP_. 
So on the average in _MATH_ a sufficient number of projective Newton steps to follow some path in _MATH_ starting at _MATH_ to find an approximate zero associated to _MATH_ is less than or equal to _MATH_ where _MATH_. 
This last corollary suggests that the average number of steps to solve polynomial systems of equations might be _MATH_. 
The reader may compare this to the result in _CITE_ which suggests that this number might be _MATH_, or to the result in _CITE_ where an upper bound to the average number of steps of _MATH_ is proved.
Since different P2P subsystems have no information exchange and there is no information redundancy in each P2P subsystem. 
Obviously, in region _MATH_, _MATH_, then we have: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the total capacity that the server allocates to location _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the total contribution of peers in region _MATH_.
The solar and interplanetary events that occurred during 4-13 September 2005 are studied based on Ooty IPS data obtained for distance ranges of the P-point from _MATH_40 to _MATH_250 R_MATH_ and at all heliographic latitudes. 
In this period, most of the solar events considered had been associated with active regions (ARs) NOAA #803 and #808, which were separated by _MATH_150_MATH_ on the solar disk. 
The former region, located close to the west limb of the Sun at the study period, produced mostly moderate flare/CME events of M-class and lesser intensity. 
However, these events were responsible for spectacular and orderly flux-rope type of ejections, as illustrated following by the Ooty IPS analyses. 
Their expansion and propagation speed in interplanetary space was much faster than the ambient solar wind during the time period considered. 
Active Region #808 produced a number of intense flare events and in fact, dominated the solar disk between 7 and 15 September 2005. 
For example, during the above period, AR#808 produced 25 flares of intensity _MATH_M-class, which included eight X-class flare events (_URL_). 
However, in association with these intense flares only 5 full-halo CME events were observed (_URL_).
From the Jacobi identity: _MATHDISP_, we obtain: _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Relations (_REF_) and (_REF_) become now: _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Formulas (_REF_), (_REF_), (_REF_), and (_REF_) can now be written as: _MATHDISP_.
As can be seen from Fig. _REF_, the absorption spectra can be represented by a sum of quasi-Lorentzian functions. 
In general, the extinction cross section can be written in the quasi-static limit _CITE_ as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the bisphere polarizability. 
The spectral representation of _MATH_ is discussed in detail in Ref. _CITE_. 
When viewed as a function of frequency, _MATH_ can be approximated by the expression _MATHDISP_.
Proof: 
Let _MATH_ be the subspace of _MATH_ generated by _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be the subset of _MATH_ consisting of all linear combinations _MATH_ for which _MATH_. 
Pick _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, then _MATH_ for each _MATH_ and so _MATH_. 
Therefore any positive real number _MATH_ will do. 
Hence we can assume that _MATH_ and so _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ and _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_. 
Therefore, to prove the proposition it suffices to show that there exists a positive real number _MATH_ satisfying the condition that _MATH_ for all _MATH_.
The mean square errors (MSEs) between the target filter and the designed filter during the GA evolution from 100 iterations to 100000 iterations are listed in Table _REF_. 
The designed coefficients with CSD structure for the FIR filter are listed in Table _REF_. 
The comparison of the frequency response between the target filter and the designed filter is depicted in Fig. _REF_. 
The frequency response in dB scale of designed filter is shown in Fig. _REF_.
Step 1: 
A large deviation principal for the laws of _MATH_ as _MATH_.
Abate and Whitt _CITE_ consider asymptotics, for compound Poisson input, of a priority system, and they also identify the two regimes. 
Importantly, the asymptotics in _CITE_ are 'exact', in that an (explicitly given) function _MATH_ is found such that _MATH_ as _MATH_, with _MATH_ being the steady-state buffer content of the low-priority queue. 
More precisely, in the transparent regime mentioned above, the exact asymptotics are of the type _MATH_ for positive constants _MATH_, _MATH_, whereas in the other regime they look like _MATH_ for positive constants _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Our results indicate that this dichotomy carries over to the more general two-node network that we briefly introduced above.
Finally, defining _MATH_ analogously with respect to _MATH_, it follows now by dominated convergence that, _MATHDISP_, thus _MATH_. 
The random variables _MATH_ are associated if and only if_MATH_, for every coordinatewise nondecreasing, continuous and bounded functions _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be coordinatewise nondecreasing, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Given _MATH_, let _MATH_ be a compact such that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_, as _MATH_ is coordinatewise nondecreasing. 
Let _MATH_, _MATH_, be a sequence in _MATH_, convergent to some _MATH_. 
As _MATH_ is compact, there exists a subsequence _MATH_, _MATH_, convergent to some _MATH_. 
Then, the corresponding subsequence _MATH_ is convergent to _MATH_, so all the coordinates of _MATH_ are nonnegative and _MATH_, that is, _MATH_ is closed. 
It is obvious, from the construction of the set _MATH_, that _MATH_ is coordinatewise nondecreasing, right continuous and _MATH_. 
We can repeat the construction to obtain a closed set _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is coordinatewise nondecreasing, right continuous and _MATH_. 
Now, taking into account Lemma _REF_, we have that _MATH_. 
On the other hand, given the construction made, _MATHDISP_. 
From (_REF_) it follows that _MATH_ and analogously _MATH_. 
So, finally we have _MATHDISP_. 
As _MATH_ was arbitrarily chosen, if follows _MATH_ so, taking into account Theorem _REF_, the variables _MATH_ are associated.
Similarly, it can be deduced from (_REF_), (_REF_) and Lemma _REF_ that _MATH_. 
We have considered the _MATH_-decay in the case of the inverted spectrum with _MATH_ eV. 
If _MATH_ eV the neutrino mass spectrum is quasi-degenerate _MATHDISP_. 
The effective Majorana mass is relatively large in this case and for both types of the neutrino mass spectrum is given by the expression _MATHDISP_.
Tables _REF_ and _REF_ display results for one simulated dataset, from each of Model 1 and 2, of length _MATH_. 
As the sample size increases, we should expect the standard error to become smaller, hence the parameter estimates to become more accurate, thus displaying consistency. 
Table _REF_ illustrates this for Model 1 under both methods-all intervals have narrowed in size, and are almost comparable across methods, with all estimates close to the true parameter values. 
However, closer inspection reveals that six of the seventeen ML intervals do not contain the true parameter value (we would expect between 0 and 4 intervals not to contain the true value from 17 independent intervals, at a 99% level); only two Bayesian intervals do not contain their true value. 
Clearer differences among methods come from observing Table _REF_ for Model 2-the Bayesian results have only one true parameter value not contained inside the 95% interval estimates. 
However, the MLEs seem biased and not tending towards the true values, with eight interval estimates not containing their true value; this includes the two negative, but not the zero, parameters in the volatility equations.
The probability of immediate failure of a device (occurrence of flare event) known to be of age _MATH_ (no flare during _MATH_) is given by the age-specific failure rate _MATH_. 
Consider a device known not to have failed at time _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be the limit of the ratio to _MATH_ of the probability of failure in time interval _MATH_ _MATHDISP_.
Suppose that product items produced in a manufacturing process are inspected in groups, where the size of each group is _MATH_, so that the number of groups inspected _MATH_ and the cumulative number of nonconforming items recorded _MATH_ follow the NBGD _MATH_. 
It is intuitively obvious that a small value of _MATH_ together with a large value of _MATH_ is an indication that the process nonconforming fraction _MATH_ is large, while a large value of _MATH_ together with a small value of _MATH_ is an indication that _MATH_ is small. 
To monitor the process, we shall define a two-dimensional control chart called the cumulative group count of conforming chart, or the CGCC chart.
Because the massless, minimally coupled scalar is not de Sitter invariant, the vacuum polarization it engenders contains two distinct tensor structures. 
One of these is proportional to the covariant transverse projection operator, whereas the other one is proportional to the purely spatial transverse projection operator constructed from _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
It is convenient to break the covariant structure function up into the old, flat space contribution _MATH_, a term _MATH_ like the conformal anomaly, and a nonlocal de Sitter contribution _MATH_. 
At one loop order one has _CITE_, _MATHDISP_. 
The one loop noncovariant structure function is _CITE_, _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_, where _MATH_ is Euler's constant. 
Although the spatial dependence of the various structure functions is limited to the coordinate separation, _MATH_, factors of _MATH_ and _MATH_ complicate the temporal dependence.
Let _MATH_ be a probability distribution on _MATH_, _MATH_ be a probability distribution on _MATH_. 
We assume that _MATH_, are independent, _MATH_ have the same distribution _MATH_, and _MATH_ have the same conditonal distribution _MATH_ under the conditon _MATH_. 
Then we have _MATHDISP_.
Skeletal primitives provide other guarantees as well. 
Assuming _MATH_ is convex, the field is necessarily continous, and is closed by definition. 
Hence, given an iso-value _MATH_, skeletal primitives also define implicit volumes: _MATHDISP_. 
The volumetric property is quite useful. 
For example, Equation _REF_ provides a trivial point containment test. 
Implicit volumes can also be trivially composed via Boolean operations. 
The union of two implicit volumes _MATH_ and _MATH_ can be described by a new scalar field, generated by functional composition _CITE_: _MATHDISP_. 
The power of this operation, and similar ones for intersection and subtraction or difference, is that they are closed under the space of all possible implicit volumes, meaning the can be applied repeatedly, each time producing another implicit volume (Figure _REF_). 
Hence, implementing solid modeling techniques such as Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is nearly trivial with implicit volumes. 
The CSG Tree is represented as a hierarchy of functional compositions such as Equation _REF_, with skeletal primitives at the leaf nodes (See Figure _REF_ for a simple example).
Let the vector-function _MATH_ satisfy the Lipschitz condition _REF_ on the set _MATH_ with a matrix _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, assume that _MATHDISP_. 
Then, for an arbitrary pair of vectors _MATH_: 
The uniform, in _MATH_, limit _MATHDISP_ exists, and moreover, _MATHDISP_.
Controller Design Problem. 
Given the local models _MATH_, the interpolation function _MATH_, _MATH_, and the matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, find the local structured controllers _MATH_, such that the closed-loop system _MATH_ is stable while satisfying some desired performance. 
Let _MATH_ be a performance measure associated to the _MATH_ nominal closed-loop system of the interconnection _MATH_. 
Two kinds of optimal design can be considered, the worst-case performance and the average performance. 
In the worst-case performance the problem to solve is as follows _MATHDISP_ whereas the average performance requires the resolution of the following optimization problem _MATHDISP_ in both cases, _MATH_ is the system matrix _MATH_ and _MATH_ represent the set of stabilizing controllers, i.e., _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, is the search domain over which the optimization problems (_REF_) and (_REF_) are considered. 
To solve the problems above we have to define the set of stabilizing controllers for the multi-model (_REF_), this is considered in the next section.
(ii) This result follows immediately from (_REF_), (_REF_) and Lemma _REF_.
For the power of the polarization components _MATH_ emitted in the lower half plane _MATH_, the relations (_REF_) are valid.
Fuel cell stack: an ElectroChem^ 7-cell stack with Nafion 115^ membrane electrodes assemblies (MEAs) is used, with a catalyst loading of 1 mg/cm_MATH_ of platinum, 50 cm_MATH_ of active area.
Of course the integrand is of crucial importance. 
From expressions (_REF_) and (_REF_) we see that _MATH_ can be broken up into seven components, _MATHDISP_. 
In each case the _MATH_ integration can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. 
For _MATH_ the _MATH_ integration also results in elementary functions. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ give polylogarithms, about which more later. 
The remaining integrands-_MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_- all take the form of _MATH_ times the _MATH_ derivative of an elementary function of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
For these integrands the best strategy is partially integrate on _MATH_ after having performed the _MATH_ integration, _MATHDISP_. 
It turns out that the surface terms in (_REF_) cancel between the three regions, _MATHDISP_.
To improve the shape quality of the quads of _MATH_, we judiciously move the control points of all B√©zier patches to improve the shape quality of all quads with respect to the quadrilateral shape quality measure called Shape and Size _CITE_. 
Let _MATH_ be a quadrilateral of _MATH_. 
Then, the Shape and Size metric for _MATH_ is _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the area of _MATH_ and _MATH_ is defined by the formula _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the area of the _MATH_-th quadrilateral in the figure above, and _MATH_ is the length of the _MATH_-side of _MATH_, for _MATH_. 
The subdivision shown in the figure is obtained by addding line segments connecting the barycenter of _MATH_ to the midpoints of its sides. 
In general, we can view the shape measure as a function, _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the set of quads of _MATH_. 
Function _MATH_ is defined in such a way that for each quad _MATH_, the larger the value of _MATH_ the better the quality of _MATH_. 
Therefore, the optimal positioning of the control points can be found by minimizing the following energy function: _MATHDISP_, To this end, we used Powell's method _CITE_ defined on the space of the coordinates of the control points. 
Because the total number of control points is smaller than the number of vertices in _MATH_, the proposed optimization mechanism turns out to be more effective than directly using the coordinates of the quad vertices.
However, Step 2 requires a numerical integration over the whole domain _MATH_ which can be computationaly costly in practice. 
Therefore, in the appendices, a second strategy is constructed. 
It is based on a local integration and requires modifying the criterion _MATH_ to optimize.
For each _MATH_, we recall from Definition _REF_ that _MATH_ denotes the probability that _MATH_ chooses action _MATH_ at state _MATH_, and from (_REF_) _MATH_. 
Moreover, it follows from Proposition _REF_ that _MATH_ is homogeneous and is denoted by _MATH_. 
In this case, if there exists an i.p.m. of _MATH_, then it is also said that it is an i.p.m. of _MATH_.
In order to develop the algorithm presented in Section _REF_ on a manycore GPU architecture we must consider the GPU model we are going to use. 
So in the CUDA parallel programming model _CITE_, an application consists of a sequential host program, that may execute parallel programs known as kernels on a manycore platform. 
Considering CUDA as development tool, a kernel is an Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) computation that is executed using a large number of parallel threads organized into a set of blocks namely grid.
It is well known that the plane is hereditary Lindel√∂f, ie. if a point set is covered by open sets, then countably many of these sets also cover the point set. 
It is easy to see that the same holds for _MATH_-fold coverings as well. 
This observation implies the following lemma.
Judging from the cell density in the images, we conclude that ORMOCORE b59, PEG-DA-258 and SZ2080 film-surfaces are an acceptable environment for adult myogenic stem cells, their number in control and test slides were comparable (Fig. _REF_a, c, d). 
Meanwhile, cell density on the AKRE23 film was apparently lesser (Fig. _REF_b). 
AO&amp;EB staining demonstrate that the cells propagated on all the tested polymeric films were stained green; it means that they all were viable. 
Representative image of AO&amp;EB stained myogenic cells grown as monolayer on SZ2080 film is shown in Fig. _REF_f.
The impact of the background field [_MATH_] on properties of energetic particles is also an important issue of this work. 
We duplicate our work in previous section for the cases that _MATH_ takes values of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 G, respectively. 
With other parameters, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ remaining unchanged, we first investigate the maximum energy obtained by particles as a function of the guide field _MATH_ for various _MATH_. 
Figures 6a and 6b plot the maximum energies of electrons and protons, respectively, versus _MATH_ in the range from 0 to 1 for the five different values of _MATH_, and each curve corresponds to a value of _MATH_. 
It is clear that the electron is accelerated to higher energy as _MATH_ increases (Figure 6a), which confirms the importance of the guide field for accelerating electrons (Litvinenko, 1996). 
However, the dependence of the maximum energy of protons on _MATH_ is not apparent. 
On the other hand, the dependence of the background field [_MATH_] is obvious such that the maximum energies of both electrons and protons decrease with _MATH_ in a straightforward way. 
This is because the strong _MATH_ yields large deflection and short acceleration times.
The results stated in this Section are well-known and relatively easy, see e.g. _CITE_ (p. 357). 
Nevertheless, we state them to make this paper self-contained and accessible to the broadest possible audience. 
The function _MATH_ decreases along each nonstationary trajectory _MATH_ of Eq. (_REF_). 
_MATH_.
We restrict attention to height fluctuations occurring after roughening has equilibrated (_MATH__MATH__MATH_). 
At each time step we identify the farthest-advanced location of the invading species, _MATH_. 
Measuring the extreme advance relative to the front's mean position, _MATH_, we obtain the maximal relative height at time _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We sample _MATH_ sufficiently to construct histograms to estimate the probability density of the extreme fluctuations _MATH_, for different propagation/mortality rates, and for different habitat sizes _MATH_.
However, it was discussed in the 4D quadratic curvature gravity _CITE_ that at the critical point, the AdS-wave log solutions may provide a dual LCFT_MATH_, while at off-critical point, its dual theory may correspond to a nonrelativistic field theory with fixed boundary conditions. 
It suggests that a similar thing may happen at the tricritical point and off-tricritical point in the 4DGMG. 
However, an explicit construction of its dual CFT is beyond the scope of the present work and thus, it is left as a future work.
ZAMS: Chemically-homogeneous lower main sequence stars are reasonably well-described by a composite polytrope model _CITE_. 
This _MATH_ ZAMS star contracts because of the sharp specific entropy gradient in the outer part of its radiative core. 
After about half of its initial mass is lost, however, the entropy profile of the remaining star has become very flat (see solid line in Fig. _REF_), and the star begins to expand in response to mass loss.
From (_REF_) we can see that the convergence rate of the synchronization is exponential and the larger the intensity of the noise is, the faster the convergence speed is. 
Moreover, the threshold of the intensity of coupled white noise can be estimated by the sufficient condition (_REF_). 
However, this kind of sufficient condition might give an over-estimated threshold of the intensity of noise. 
The simulation results in next section will show that outer synchronization could be caused by a white noise with much less value of intensity than the threshold estimated by the inequality (_REF_).
We shall impose the following four conditions:
 the stochastic process described by the CME, Eq. _REF_, can only contain a finite number of states;
the CME, Eq. _REF_, can be non-dimensionalized so that the resulting equation depends on a unique small (non-dimensional) parameter _MATH_;
 the corresponding transition matrix _MATH_ can be written as _MATH_, where _MATH_ is lower triangular (possibly after a relabeling of states);
 the weight of cycles of length 2 in _MATH_ is _MATH_ (of exact order _MATH_), while cycles of length greater than 2 carry a weight of _MATH_.
The above ground-track techniques neglect heights of EIT waves by assuming that all emission originates from the spherical solar surface. 
Near disk center, this inconsistency causes only a negligibly small error in travel distance at a constant height, e.g. _MATH_1 % for _MATH_. 
Near the limb, however, any change in height ( e.g. vertical propagation) can result in significant overestimates of velocities projected onto the spherical surface, as demonstrated in 3D MHD simulations _CITE_. 
3D reconstruction of EIT waves from STEREO observations has been recently attempted with triangulation techniques _CITE_. 
In doing so, extra care must be taken to account for optically thin EUV wave emission, whose integration along different lines of sight never corresponds to the same feature, unlike optically thick emission ( e.g some line emission from prominences).
More specifically, we will describe in this paper the optical response and the field distribution in the linear chain of coupled spheres under the excitation conditions that would have generated fundamental modes in an isolated sphere, using a combination of numerical and approximate analytical calculations. 
The general results will be applied to particular cases of _MATH_, 4 and 5 spheres.
The fuselage is structurally equivalent to a beam, doubly supported by the attachments of the two wings; proper longitudinal positions of the wings could reduce significantly the maximum bending moment and, thus, structural weight of fuselage. 
In order to put the two fins far each other to check the aeroelastic constraints, the fuselage is enlarged horizontally; sections are designed to carry flight loads and pressurization. 
Contrary to conventional aircraft, the lifting system is over-constrained to fuselage and it can be easily designed as "Damage Tolerant".
To ensure that optimal education subsidies are zero in the absence of general equilibrium effects, the earnings function is weakly separable in ability, education, and labor. 
The elasticity of the production function is also assumed to be constant under linear policies, and is denoted by _MATH_ _CITE_. 
In general equilibrium, the high-ability type is assumed to earn a higher gross wage than the low-ability type so as to obtain an economically meaningful redistribution problem, i.e. _MATH_. 
This assumption guarantees that gross labor earnings for the high-ability type are always larger than gross labor earnings of the low-ability type.
As mentioned in the introduction, the KEK-PS E325 experiment reported evidence for a large excess to the left of _MATH_ peak in p-Cu at 12 GeV for _MATH_, corresponding to a produced _MATH_ moving very slowly inside the heavy target nucleus at rest. 
This situation is not directly comparable to the high energy regime discussed in this paper. 
Here, a fireball is produced with particle momenta boosted in the forward direction, therefore the relevant variable to select _MATH_ mesons mostly sensing the medium is transverse momentum. 
Moreover, in a high energy heavy ion collision, as opposed to p-A, the _MATH_ can be produced not only at chemical freeze-out, but also in the hot hadronic medium via kaon reactions. 
Fig. _REF_ shows the region around the _MATH_ mass peak for different _MATH_ and centrality selections: the left panel shows the two most central bins and for _MATH_ GeV, while the right panel shows the data integrated in centrality for _MATH_ GeV. 
The continuum from the subtraction is smooth also in this case. 
Furthermore, a fit was performed using the Monte Carlo shapes for the different processes. 
The continuum was described with the model of Ref._CITE_, which includes, besides the in-medium _MATH_, multi-pion and partonic processes relevant in this mass region. 
The model of Ref. _CITE_, having different weights for the multi-pion and partonic processes, does not change the conclusions, since it produces a similar yield below the _MATH_ peak. 
The _MATH_ is _MATH_ in all cases. 
There is no evidence of any mass shift or broadening, even at high centrality and low _MATH_, where one would expect to observe the strongest in-medium effects.
Potential advantages for the BWB configuration could be a significant reduction in weight, less engine power required and a reduction in fuel burn per seat mile. 
The centerbody shields forward radiated noise emitted by the fan and engine exhaust, noise is not reflected downward by the wing. 
An engine failure cannot impact the pressure vessel, other engines, fuel tanks or systems; fuel is separated from the passenger by large cargo bays and the trailing edge controls are redundant.
Chemical reaction kinetics have traditionally been modeled by means of rate equations. 
These are (sets of) deterministic ordinary differential equations that describe the time-evolution of the concentrations of chemical species; see, e.g., _CITE_ and the references therein. 
However, it is well known that chemical reaction kinetics are inherently stochastic _CITE_: while the dynamics average out and appear deterministic if the spatial scale is sufficiently large, on mesoscopic scales the probabilistic nature of reaction networks cannot be ignored _CITE_. 
Hence, rate equations are useful in the description of reaction kinetics in macroscopic volumes such as test tubes and large-size chemical reactors, but cannot accurately describe the kinetics in smaller volumes; a prominent example are biochemical reactions occurring inside biological cells _CITE_.
This paper presents generic arguments to explain the almost-quadratic dependence of temperature on the velocity in the SW and the absence of dependence in ICMEs (when the entire distribution of data points is considered). 
These results are expected to hold for a broad range of heating mechanisms, so the observed _MATH_ relation is not a decisive tool to test diverse heating/accelerating mechanisms of the SW. 
However, it does not mean that the _MATH_ relation is independent of the heating, just that it is expected to be weakly depend on it. 
The analysis of this dependence will be investigated in a future work.
This hypothesis makes the diffusion equation (_REF_) parabolic and hence the solution _MATH_ with nonnegative initial value _MATH_ becomes strictly positive for all _MATH_ and hence the satisfaction measure _MATH_ is well defined for all _MATH_. 
Notice that the meaning of the diffusion could be clearer if a starvation measure, say _MATH_, is used instead of the satisfaction measure. 
However, in that case, if _MATH_ or _MATH_ has a sign change, then _MATH_ is not defined. 
That is why we are using the satisfaction measure _MATH_ with a decreasing motility function _MATH_ for _MATH_.
Le t in the Hilbert space _MATH_ there is a unitary representation _MATH_ of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group and let be given a family of self-adjoint operators _MATH_ parameterized by the regions _MATH_ in Minkowski space-time where _MATH_ is an arbitrary index. 
Let us suppose that the unitary operator translations act as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is a 4-dimensional vector and _MATH_ is a shift of _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
Let be given also a family of operators _MATH_ with similar properties. 
Suppose that one has a representation _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_ for which the operators commute _MATHDISP_ 
The correlation function (_REF_) describes the results of a simultaneous measurement. 
Moreover we suppose that the range of _MATH_ is the spectrum of _MATH_ and the range of _MATH_ is the spectrum of _MATH_. 
Then we say that the quadruplet _MATHDISP_ satisfies theELR (Einstein local realism) condition.
By defining _MATHDISP_, (_REF_) can be equivalently written as the following system of linear equations: for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the following lower triangular matrix _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the following lower triangular matrix _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
We will also discretize (_REF_) and so the new objective function is _MATHDISP_
Rather than partition the constraint forces we can specify a set of conditions on the constraint forces. 
In the case that _MATH_ (motion actuated) and we choose to control both task and null space we have, _MATHDISP_, complemented by the following conditions on the constraints forces, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_, and the passivity constraints, _MATHDISP_. 
This can be expressed as the following system of _MATH_ equations, _MATHDISP_. 
A block diagram of this control scheme is shown in Fig. _REF_.
Boundary Value Problems with Derivatives in Nonlinear Terms
As a comparison study, the statistics of the 66 magnetic storms are shown in Figure 2b. 
We can see that the numbers of weak magnetic storms (_MATH_) associated with the same-side events and the opposite-side events are 9 and 6, respectively; for moderate magnetic storms (_MATH_), the numbers are 17 and 5, respectively; and for intense magnetic storms (_MATH_), the numbers are 22 and 7, respectively. 
To sum up, there are 48 magnetic storms caused by the same-side events, while only 18 magnetic storms resulted from the opposite-side events, the ratio is _MATH_.
The incident light in the _MATH_ direction is simulated by a Gaussian transverse electrically (TE) polarized light (nonzero _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_) having a spatial width of _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
Electromagnetic field propagation in the Y-shaped waveguide is calculated by using the standard 2D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method _CITE_ in the spatial domain of _MATH_ which is terminated by the perfectly matched layer absorbing boundaries _CITE_.
An alternative approach is a proper and modern use of optimization strategies: the design problem is entirely formulated as an optimization problem, the requirements concerning the elastic symmetries being part of the problem, as an objective or a constraint, according with the problem at hand. 
Under a mathematical point of view, this leads to the formulation of a global optimization problem, in the double sense that the feasible domain is not reduced by simplifying rules and that the global minimum of the objective function has to be found. 
Such problems are generally non convex, the objective function is highly non-linear. 
Nevertheless, modern strategies of computation can effectively approach and solve such problems.
In the case of the sheet including a single X-point, the existence of the guide field is very important for the particle acceleration. 
It not only helps particles to stay in accelerating region longer to obtain the higher energy, but also separates the energetic electrons and protons from one another. 
When the guide field is strong and parallel to the electric field, energetic electrons leave the current sheet mainly along the upper-left and lower-right magnetic separatrices in the _MATH__MATH_-plane, and protons leave the sheet along the upper-right and lower-left separatrices. 
We found that the guide field causes particles to be selected to accelerate according to their initial positions. 
In the coordinate system described by Figure 2a, the electrons of initial positions in the first and the third quadrants can be accelerated more easily and acquire more energy than those of initial positions in the second and the fourth quadrants. 
For protons, on the other hand, the acceleration favorable initial positions are mainly in the second and fourth quadrants. 
The energy spectrum of both particles has the form of power-law.
Define _MATH_ and _MATH_, and then the error system (_REF_) and the desired state trajectories equation (_REF_) can be rewritten as _MATHDISP_, which is called the augmented system of the error system (_REF_). 
Here, the arguments _MATH_ and _MATH_ are viewed as two new state vectors of the augmented system. 
By these augmentation, the augmented system (_REF_) has higher dimension than the original error system (_REF_), and there is no time variable explicitly appearing in the equation (_REF_).
From the assumption _MATH_, we can easily see that (0, 0, 0) is always a equilibrium of system (1.1). 
We can rewrite the nonlinear system (1.1) in a matrix form as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Choosing the coefficient _MATH_ as a bifurcation parameter and introducing a "state-feedback control" _MATH_, we obtain a linear system with a non-linear feedback as follows _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a unit matrix, _MATHDISP_. 
Next, taking Laplace transform on (2.2), we obtain the standard transfer matrix of the linear part of the system: _MATHDISP_. 
If this feedback system is linearized about the equilibrium _MATH_, then the Jacobian of (2.3) is given by _MATHDISP_. 
So, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Set _MATHDISP_. 
Then, we obtain the following results by applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion with _MATH_.
The parallelized versions, ArrayExpansion and RegionBased, run on only the hardware threads, as the context switching of SPE threads causes enormous overheads to preserve their context such as the large register file and local stores of the SPE. 
On the Cell processor packaged in a PS3, up to eight hardware threads can run at the same time; two on the PPE by hardware simultaneous multithreading and the rest on the six SPEs. 
But still, the IBM-SSC compiler creates up to seven threads, one PPE thread and six SPE threads, even though the environment variable is set to be larger than seven. 
Therefore, in this experiment, the ArrayExpansion runs on the seven threads all of which perform the actual computation of irregular reduction loops. 
RegionBased also runs on the seven threads, except that the PPE thread is dedicated for task scheduling.

Power spectral densities of a nominal digital approximation and the corresponding worst case due to DLL cell delays variation with and without antenna filtering.
A more realistic form of the benefits is _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, that we call surplus, is a function depending on time _MATH_ and on the fund level within the time interval _MATH_. 
With this form of benefits, the equation for the wealth process _MATH_ becomes a stochastic delay differential equation that can be treated with the tools of stochastic optimal control in infinite dimension like the ones introduced in, e.g., _CITE_ (see _CITE_ for a first study of this problem).
From _REF_ and _REF_ we have that _MATHDISP_, maps _MATH_ into _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
By Lemma _REF_, _MATH_ is nonexpansive and _MATH_.
Introducing two functions, _MATHDISP_. 
We can see that Fig. _REF_-a has the following contributions: _MATHDISP_, while for Fig. _REF_-b we have, for _MATH_: _MATHDISP_
Now, we shall display a more exact solution for the separatrix. 
The solution associated to the separatrix is such that _MATH_ is not identically null and such that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Hence, _MATH_ has a bell shape with a maximum and vanishes in _MATH_. 
Let us come back to the equation of motion: _MATHDISP_
Obviously, the Nikodym domain _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_ if and only if _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, _MATH_, _MATH_, i.e. _MATH_ if and only if _MATHDISP_.
We go further into the problem using the standard model _MATHDISP_. 
This is the _MATH_ model, with spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
Here we are using natural units, and we have rescaled the field, and the space and time coordinates to make them dimensionless. 
This model has as topological defects the BPS states _MATH_, and we choose the center of the solutions at the origin _MATH_, for simplicity. 
The energy density is given by _MATH_, which gives the energy _MATH_. 
We also note that the potential has minima at _MATH_ and obeys: _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, where _MATH_, etc. 
Next, if we choose the deformation function in the form _MATH_, we get to the potential _MATHDISP_. 
In this case the deformation function depends only on _MATH_, and the corresponding deformed model describes the sine-Gordon model, with no extra parameter involved in the procedure. 
This model has solutions described by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ identifies the particular topological sector of the sine-Gordon model, which has an infinity of sectors. 
We then see that we go from the _MATH_ model, which contains a single topological sector, to the sine-Gordon model, which contains an infinity of topological sectors, by the use of the deformation _MATH_, which is a periodic function, which needs the presence of the integer _MATH_ to identify the particular periodic sector, which is naturally used to identify the particular topological sector of the deformed model, as we have just shown.
The remaining two cases are similar, and lead to no solutions.
The existence of limit points with the stated properties follows from the a priori estimate for the solution and stage values, respectively, provided by Theorem _REF_, that is, from the boundedness of the associated piecewise constant interpolants in _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
By the feasibility result, Lemma _REF_, any limit point _MATH_ of _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_. 
For an element _MATH_, in accordance with the density result, we choose a common subsequence of integer pairs _MATH_ and sequences of elements _MATH_ as well as _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, see Lemma _REF_; here, for simplicity, we do not distinguish the sequence of pairs _MATH_ and the chosen subsequence in notation, and set _MATH_ etc. 
Inserting the piecewise constant interpolant _MATH_ defined by _MATH_ for _MATH_ into the relaxed formulation of the discrete variational inequality _REF_ yields _MATHDISP_. 
Performing the limit _MATH_, using strong convergence of _MATH_ to _MATH_ in _MATH_, of _MATH_ to _MATH_ in _MATH_, of _MATH_ to _MATH_ in _MATH_, of _MATH_ to _MATH_ in _MATH_, weak convergence of _MATH_ to _MATH_ in _MATH_, and the required LSC condition, see Hypothesis _REF_, implies that _MATH_ solves the relaxed formulation of the variational inequality _MATHDISP_, see _REF_; we recall that by the consistency condition of Hypothesis _REF_ it holds _MATH_ and consequently _MATH_ as well as _MATH_. 
Neural networks (NNs) _CITE_ are powerful mathematical models inspired by the human brain. 
A trained NN is capable of representing any non-linear relationship between input and output data. 
Thus, a NN can carry out tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, and function approximation _CITE_. 
NNs have remained conservative towards the emerging field of optimisation in the presence of concept drift. 
It has been assumed that the standard NN training algorithms that employ gradient descent are implicitly dynamic _CITE_, and if the NN fails to adapt to the drifting concepts, then restarting the training process would be the most efficient solution. 
In order to avoid re-training, redundancy in the form of ensemble classifiers has also been proposed _CITE_. 
The chances of obtaining at least one acceptable solution using ensemble classifiers are increased by training a number of separate NNs on the same problem over different time periods. 
However, the ensemble approach does not offer any training algorithm improvements to make each classifier aware of concept drift.
Curvature as Rate of Change of Tangential Angle. 
Assume an arc _MATH_ in the Euclidean plane which is a segment of a smooth Jordan curve. 
Thus we have a tangent _MATH_ defined at any point _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
This tangent describes an angle _MATH_ with the positive _MATH_-axis, called the slope angle. 
See Figure _REF_..
Let _MATH_ be a simple game, the Shapley-Shubik index (Shapley and Shubik 1954) is the vector _MATH_, given by _MATHDISP_, which is the version of the Shapley value (Shapley 1953) for simple games.
Note that notwithstanding our use of a representationalist jargon, the hypothesis of possible cognitive pressures towards good signaling does not depend on taking a representationalist stance in the representationalists vs. dynamicists debate. 
Even the most radical enthusiast of the dynamical approach to cognition and the most critic or skeptic on the use of the notion of representation for explaining adaptive behavior _CITE_ acknowledges that an organism's behavior depends also on internal (neural) dynamics. 
Hence, the same single assumption is needed, from a dynamical systems point of view, for accepting the possibility of a possible cognitive pressure towards good signaling: namely, the assumption that signaling behavior is internally linked to the brain structures that govern also other non-communicative behaviors. 
In fact, for an organism's behavior to be adaptive, different adaptive conditions will be correlated with different internal dynamics, which in turn will tend to be reflected in different signaling behavior. 
But this is exactly what the hypothesis on a cognitive pressure towards good signalling states: that produced signals will tend to spontaneously reflect adaptively relevant situations due to the need for organisms to cope adaptively with their environment.
Chirally, _MATH_ transforms as _MATH_ while _MATH_ transforms as _MATH_. 
As a consequence _MATH_ is a manifestly covariant operator (i.e., chiral rotations act as similarity transformations on it) which is local and of the Klein-Gordon type. 
This is the operator we were looking for. 
A formal hand-waving argument shows that _MATH_ is the chiral invariant part of the chiral determinant _MATH_. 
This is as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
In the second equality we have used that _MATH_ and _MATH_ have the same effective action. 
This is because the trace of products involving an odd number of _MATH_ (with or without _MATH_) vanish, and so only terms with an even number of _MATH_ will give a contribution to _MATH_. 
(In other way, in even dimensions the representations _MATH_ and _MATH_ are equivalent.) 
Therefore, we can symmetrize with respect to _MATH_. 
In the third and fourth equalities we make use of the formal identity _MATHDISP_. 
It implies that (formally) operators commute inside _MATH_ and so the factors can be rearranged at will.
Given the stringent cut on the DIS selection, the data of Ref. _CITE_ constrain the valence-quark fracture-function contributions, _MATH_, which in fact almost saturate the spectrum, as shown in the left column plots of Fig. (_REF_). 
The plots in the first row of Fig. (_REF_) show instead a normalisation tension between _MATH_ data from Ref. _CITE_ and Ref. _CITE_ which, however, can be tolerated in view of the partial _MATH_ presented in Tab. (_REF_). 
The plots in the second row show a slight shape deformation in the predictions for _MATH_ data from Ref. _CITE_ which is probably due to the normalisation constraint induced by _MATH_ data from Ref. _CITE_ on the individual _MATH_ and _MATH_ distributions. 
These results indeed indicate, as expected, that Lambdas are produced more abundantly and more forward by the fragmentation of _MATH_-spectator system with respect to a _MATH_-one.
The phirotopes _MATH_ and _MATH_ of _MATH_ resp. _MATH_ are given in Lemmas _REF_ and _REF_. 
Lemma _REF_ and _REF_ prove that, given a phirotope _MATH_ with underlying matroid _MATH_, the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are indeed phirotopes with underlying matroids _MATH_ resp. _MATH_. 
Proposition _REF_ proves that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The last part of Lemma _REF_, together with Theorem _REF_, then proves the duality result.
To make this idea rigorous, we proceed as follows. 
Assume that _MATH_ is nonamenable. 
Then there exists a finite nonempty _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for all finite nonempty _MATH_. 
Without loss of generality we may assume that _MATH_ is symmetric. 
Let _MATH_ be a random walk in _MATH_, independent of _MATH_ and _MATH_, starting in _MATH_, that jumps from a point _MATH_ to a point _MATH_ with probability _MATH_. 
Then (_REF_) implies that _MATHDISP_. 
By the stationarity of the process _MATH_, one has _MATHDISP_. 
On the other hand, we will show that the nonamenability of _MATH_ implies that _MATHDISP_, which with (_REF_) leads to a contradiction in (_REF_). 
Let _MATH_ be the Hilbert space of square summable real functions on _MATH_, equipped with the inner product _MATH_, let _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then, by the fact that nearest-neighbor random walk on any nonamenable Cayley graph has a spectral gap (see _CITE_ or _CITE_), there exists a _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, which proves (_REF_).
Chapter 12 deals with estimates of norms in CG computations. 
This subject is reviewed, with an extensive biography, also in _CITE_. 
An important point on relation to a priori error bounds in finite element discretization of the elliptic self-adjoint model problem is presented in Section 12.7, with references to the pioneering work of Arioli and his coauthors. 
In recent papers _CITE_, information on the algebraic part of the error is integrated into a posteriori error estimates (with references to related work in this fast developing area).
If only _MATH_ acts on _MATH_, with _MATH_ arbitrary, from (_REF_) one gets _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, with _MATH_ the second order unit tensor, is the generalized Hamilton-Eshelby tensor obtained with a different procedure in [M02].
Many European countries face high equilibrium unemployment rates at a time when their public finances are already overstretched. 
Policy makers have therefore shifted away their attention from resource-consuming public subsidies to resource-conserving reforms of the labor tax structure as ways to address the unemployment problem. 
The formal theory on labor tax reform offers surprisingly little guidance on what kind of reform policy makers should embark on to reduce equilibrium unemployment without putting the government's revenue position at risk. 
In this context, the paper has embedded a search and matching model of the labor market in a small open economy model, featuring endogenous labor supply, progressive wage taxes, and payroll taxes. 
With the aid of the model, we study a simple and practicable labor tax reform strategy.
In this chapter we investigate the DCJ and algebraic distances and how they are found. 
We introduce a new graphical method to determine the permutation cycles, which embody the composition permutation for the genome transformation in the algebraic method. 
This graphical method helps tie the two approaches together. 
We discuss how in the usual approaches, the two methods differ only in the distance component due to the even paths in the adjacency graph of Bergeron, Mixtacki, and Stoye; these involve operations changing the type and number of chromosomes, such as fission, fusion, altering chromosome type from circular to linear and vice versa. 
Besides discussing each distance individually, we compare their internal mechanisms. 
So for example, without caps the algebraic approach has a different weighting scheme for even paths than the standard DCJ. 
However, when caps are added, the two have the same weighting scheme. 
Another convention which can be done in multiple ways is the method of closure. 
We discuss how to implement the original closure rule by which we arrive at the expected weighting scheme for the DCJ. 
Instead, by a new alternative closure rule which we introduce, the distance diverts to the algebraic distance. 
Finally, we note that although the Bergeron, Mixtacki, and Stoye way of computing the DCJ via the adjacency graph does away with "fictitious" caps and nulls, vestiges of fictitious operations remain, as the resulting weighting scheme is equivalent to that of the conventional DCJ.
This paper presents a laser-based technique for surface preparation of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) for bonded repair. 
Ablative and non-ablative treatment of the surface is produced by variation of laser power and the resulting surface energy determined by goniometric measurements. 
Wettability has been directly related to a calculated wetting envelope. 
The investigations show an additional major influence of the surface topography on the shear strength of the joint. 
The direction of the applied laser lines in relation to the fibre direction was identified as an essential influence for this roughness. 
A ns IR-laser demonstrates high potential for surface preparation as well as selective ply removal. 
The laser prepared surfaces are examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and contact angle measurements. 
The wettability studies show a significant increment in surface energy after laser treatment, in relation to non-treated as well as surface grinding samples.
Next we set _MATHDISP_ 
We assume _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are functions in _MATH_. 
Note that (8.2.16)-(8.2.18) give _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
More specifically, we consider here the flexural behaviour of bending-extension uncoupled laminates composed of identical layers; the plate is rectangular, with sides' length a and b, respectively along the axes x and y. 
Along its boundary, the plate is simply supported and its mass per unit area is _MATH_. 
A constraint is imposed on the anisotropy of the laminate: tensor D* has to be orthotropic and the axes of orthotropy to be aligned with the axes of the plate. 
These assumptions, along with that of uncoupling, are needed for having exact solutions for flexural problems and are, anyway, those normally used by designers. 
We bound ourselves to remark here that it is possible to find uncoupled laminates with D* orthotropic, see _CITE_ for more details.
To assign the spectrum zeros to the origin, it is simply necessary to solve for the weighting parameters _MATH_ in _REF_. 
Either of the following choices: _MATHDISP_ leads to a sampled power spectral density with no zeros, i.e., _MATHDISP_ _MATH_
Note that if _MATH_ then _MATH_ is degenerate. 
Indeed, from _REF_ we see that _MATH_ implies _MATH_.
Actions of semigroups are important both in mathematics and computer science. 
The theory of machines developed so far has largely influenced the develoment of computer science and its associated language. 
In this section we discuss semigroup actions and their applications to the theory of state machines to unify computer science with the mainstream mathematics.
Therefore, the CRLB for TBRE in a separable multipath channel can be obtained as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is SNR in the received direct path by assuming _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the direct path. 
One can see that, (_REF_) is similar to the CRLB for TBRE in a single path channel: _MATH_, as given in _CITE_.
It should be expected that the use of targets with greater _MATH_ (for example, _MATH_, as in [9]) will provide a higher analyzing power of the polarimeter, however, in this case the exact expressions for calculations of functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ have to be used (see for example, [6]).
Step 2. 
Let us prove now that _MATH_. 
It is straightforward that _MATH_ is one-sided resource monotonic and consistent. 
Then, by Lemma _REF_, _MATH_ is conversely consistent. 
Therefore, in application of Lemma _REF_, it is sufficient to show that both _MATH_ and _MATH_ coincide in the two-agent case. 
Then, let us consider the problem _MATH_ where _MATH_. 
Without loss of generality we can assume that _MATH_. 
Suppose first that _MATH_. 
By peak-only, fairness, agenda-independence, and the definition of the standard, _MATH_. 
Let us suppose now that _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, all rules solve the problem in the same way, _MATH_. 
There are two remaining cases:
Finally, we can also estimate the relative contribution of the nonlinear damping term _MATH_ in the evolution equation _REF_, and find it to be a non negligible one-tenth of the linear term _MATH_ (see Eq. _REF_) at the estimated amplitude of _MATH_.
Following _CITE_ we can find for equation (_REF_) several sets of solutions that can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. 
Taking into account the behavior of positive and negative energy states we can classify our two sets as follows; for the "in" states we have _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_, with _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
The factors _MATH_ and _MATH_ are determined by the use of the normalization condition (_REF_) which explains the conservation of the Klein Gordon particle current.
The second assertion follows from the first since there are monomial ideals that have non-cellular minimal resolutions _CITE_; therefore we prove that if _MATH_ is a non-cellular minimal resolution then so does _MATH_. 
As proposition does not involve looking at the behavior of _MATH_ and _MATH_ in two different characteristics, so, for the duration of this proof, we may assume that Construction _REF_ is done over _MATH_ instead of _MATH_. 
Hereafter, we assume that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are _MATH_-ideals.
A typical simulation domain is shown in Figure _REF_. 
The box is 4 Mm wide in the _MATH_ and _MATH_ directions and 8 Mm high in the vertical z direction, and has a resolution of 144 _MATH_ 144 _MATH_ 512 grid points, respectively. 
The upper boundary of the domain is well within the solar corona.
Let _MATH_ be a gyrotriangle with a gyrocevian _MATH_ that joins vertex _MATH_ with a point _MATH_ on the interior of side _MATH_ in an Einstein gyrovector space _MATH_. 
Furthermore, let _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the ingyrocenters of the ingyrocircles of gyrotriangles _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, touching the side _MATH_ and the gyrocevian _MATH_ at the tangency points _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, Fig. _REF_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_
The spatial gradient of the background electron density plays an important role in the dynamics of Langmuir waves. 
It has been shown before (e.g. _CITE_) that Langmuir waves are refracted to different k-vectors by the inhomogeneous background electron density gradient (Term 2 of the left hand side of Equation (_REF_)). 
The radial dependence in this process is mostly governed by the characteristic scale of plasma inhomogeneity _MATH_. 
For a simple solar wind plasma model where density only decreases _MATH_ is strictly negative. 
When fluctuations are added to mimic the turbulent nature of the solar wind _MATH_ not only becomes positive in parts but varies more in magnitude. 
Such fluctuations in the background electron density can suppress Langmuir wave growth by moving Langmuir waves to higher and lower k-vectors, out of resonance with inducing electrons.
Proof: 
The prove of the two equalities is slimily, we only prove the latter. 
Let _MATH_ be the unique positive solution of (1.1), then the function _MATHDISP_ satisfies equation _MATHDISP_ 
Next we consider the solution of equation _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_.
In this and all subsequent simulations in this paper the constrained dynamics were numerically integrated with a time step of 1 ms. Baumgarte stabilization _CITE_ was used to stabilize the constraints. 
Given the constraint stabilized system of equations _CITE_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the constraint stabilization parameters, the generalized accelerations are, _MATHDISP_, and the Lagrange multipliers are, _MATHDISP_.
When _MATH_ is idempotent. The Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of _MATH_- is just _MATH_ itself. 
Premultiplying _REF_ by _MATH_ is equivalent to transforming _REF_ into a model _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The transformation is called covariance transformation. 
The least squares estimator (LS) (or a generalized least squares estimator (GLS)) of _REF_, _MATHDISP_, is called covariance estimator or within estimator because the estimation of _MATH_ only makes use of within (group) variation of _MATH_ and _MATH_ only. 
The covariance estimator of _MATH_ turns out to be also the least squares estimator of _REF_. 
It is the best linear unbiased estimator of _MATH_ if _MATH_ is treated as fixed and _MATH_ is i.i.d.
After this preprocessing we deal only with the indecomposable case and get a priori ball which is guaranteed to contain the unique minimizer of (_REF_). 
The radius of this ball is expressed in terms of the complexity of the corresponding representation: _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the complexity of the initial tuple _MATH_.
In the following section, we describe the dynamic behavior of the full system. 
In particular, we investigate the formation of rolls and cells in various parameter regimes. 
We note, that all the results agree with the linear analysis; namely, regimes where there are unstable models (Peclet number close to 200), yield non-uniform solutions. 
We are able to distinguish between rolls and cells in the nonlinear regime.
Finally, in Fig. _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_ the outcomes of three different cases when the references are always from a pause or stop frame are shown. 
As can be seen from the figures, the presence of pause or stop as reference, no significant update occurs in the proposed LMS algorithm and in some cases, as expected, the convergence performance degrades. 
This is because of the lack of reference data as well as signal energy, which are required for LMS updates.
Let us show that combining quasi-linear methods of asymptotic integration, such as Krylov-Bogolyubov averaging, with NSTT leads to a closed form analytical solution for piece-wise linear oscillator (_REF_).
If the two vectors _MATH_ and _MATH_ are linearly independent then the cross product vector _MATH_ is defined as, _MATH_, _MATH_. 
More specifically _MATH_ is given as, _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ is orthogonal to _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ be the mapping from _MATH_ to _MATH_ satisfying that for each _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
This mapping _MATH_ is called the stack filtering operator with window width _MATH_ associate to the stack filter _MATH_.
In the present work, we determine the energy needed to move a heavy test quark along a circle of radius _MATH_ with angular frequency _MATH_ through the strongly coupled plasma of _MATH_ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory. 
We are interested in this problem since it provides a novel perspective on several of the open questions mentioned above. 
Because in vacuum a rotating colored particle would emit synchrotron radiation, studying a particle moving in a circle with constant angular velocity through a strongly coupled plasma is well suited to studying the relative strength of, and interplay between, radiation and medium-induced energy loss, as a function of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It will also allow us to compare radiation in medium and in vacuum. 
Also, in contrast to linear motion with acceleration, the case of rotation at constant angular velocity can be formulated as an essentially time-independent problem even though it includes acceleration. 
Finally, stirring a strongly coupled plasma by a rotating quark is a well-localized source of plasma perturbations whose propagation and dissipation is described in the dual gravity theory by the trailing string. 
We leave the translation from the trailing string description to the corresponding stress-energy tensor describing the disturbance of the gauge theory plasma to future work.
(i) _MATH_ is closed at _MATH_ because _MATH_ is closed (by Corollary 12 in Amaya et al 2008), so that_MATH_ is closed at _MATH_.
The average velocity defined by Eq. (14) is one character of the active degree and the convergence state of the particle swarm. 
Thus, an adaptive updating equation of the inertia factor _MATH_ by the average velocity is designed as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the maximum of the _MATH_th dimensional velocity. 
The inertia factor _MATH_ is limited in _MATH_, hence the differential equation (_REF_) is stable.
The above results of plume diagnosis are all obtained with a relatively high flunece of 3 J/cm_MATH_. 
Figure _REF_ displays the dependence of the saturation ion current on the fluence. 
(This time the probe size is increased to 1 cm_MATH_to collect more ions.) 
It is shown that below 1 J/cm_MATH_, the ion current is vanishing (and the plume also becomes nearly invisible). 
However, with this seemingly very weak ablation, we still observe significant material removal, and the ablated material mostly exists as small particles. 
The results are described in detail below.
A typical scenario of wave propagation is demonstrated by snapshots in Figures _REF_ and _REF_ for the vertical _MATH_ and the horizontal _MATH_ components of velocity, respectively. 
In the presence of magnetic field the field lines act as an excellent wave guide. 
The propagation of the perturbations has a behaviour distinct from that found in the hydrodynamic case. 
As it has already been shown by _CITE_, the excitation of the slow and fast waves occurs independently from the polarization of the acoustic perturbation source. 
Thus, the vertically oscillating driver generates both fast ( i.e. _MATH_) and slow ( i.e. _MATH_) magneto-acoustic waves. 
Figures _REF_ and _REF_ clearly show the difference between the propagation of the high-frequency fast and slow magneto-acoustic waves through the computational domain. 
The slow waves (see Figure _REF_), which are mainly localised at the centre of the magnetised equilibrium and propagate parallel to the magnetic field above the mode conversion region, carry the main part of the wave energy to the solar corona. 
Comparing Figure _REF_ and Figure _REF_, it is clear that the amplitude of the slow magnetosonic waves leaking through the transition region for the MHD case is approximately ten times larger than for the acoustic waves generated by the driver with the same amplitude in the HD case. 
Also, the waves experience a relatively low reflection by the transition region.
Much effort is spent on discussing communication. 
Maybe, because communication or more scientifically SI accompanies the humans all life long.
Let _MATH_ be a bar-and-joint framework. 
Then there exists an _MATH_ such that for all _MATH_ with _MATH_ for all _MATH_, we have _MATH_.
It appears that as the coupling coefficient _MATH_ increases from _MATH_, where the ring of coupled self-sustained systems is on the unstable synchronized states (and therefore all Lyapunov exponents are positive), the mode _MATH_ is the first one to move from the unstable to the stable domain. 
On the other hand, _MATH_ is the last mode that leaves from the unstable domain to enter the stable state. 
At this point, the ring is on the stable synchronized state; when the coupling coefficient _MATH_ is further increased, the mode _MATH_ is the first mode to move from the stable domain to the unstable one, and the mode _MATH_ is the last one. 
For the case of the positive coupling coefficient _MATH_, the reverse situation is observed: the _MATH_ mode is the first to become stable. 
Also in the case (ii) with _MATH_ and _MATH_, is found a similar behavior.
First we compare window No.1 with Hanning window, Hamming windows and compare window No.2 with Blackman window. 
Figure 4.1 shows the relative errors of the magnitude responses of differentiators obtained by using the five windows. 
It can be observed from the figure that window No.1 is much better than both Hanning and Hamming windows and window No.2 is better than Blackman window in terms of differentiator performaces. 
In addition, the change of the ripples of the relative errors of differentiators obtained by using the two new windows are small.
Creep tests at _MATH_ for different pre-load levels.
(iii) the positioning error _MATH_ is asymptotically stable, i.e. _MATH_ as _MATH_ with all states bounded and the constraint _MATH_ is never violated.
The one-sided transition probabilities are identical in all directions and are varied from _MATH_ to _MATH_ with steps of _MATH_. 
The model domain consists of a rectangle with two active lithologies. 
The first and last column of the model domain represent the locations of the wells and the prescribed lithologies in these columns do no change. 
In Fig. _REF_ four different realisations are shown. 
They were obtained with the parameter settings of the reference experiment (_MATH_ in table _REF_). 
These four realisations clearly show the stochastic variability. 
The persistences were equal in all directions and set to _MATH_ for both lithologies. 
Initially _MATH_ was _MATH_. 
The converged subsurface characterisations obtained with the CA-method will in general be periodic. 
In this case we show the first global state in this periodic attractor.
The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1.1) serves as a model for various problems in physics. 
For the last twenty years, (1.1) has received considerable attention as its solutions seem both mathematically intriguing and scientifically useful. 
We would like to mention earlier results on existence of entire solutions of Schrodinger type equations with or without potentials which was studied in _CITE_ (see references therein).
We study a discounted maxmin control problem with general state space. 
The controller is unsure about his model in the sense that he also considers a class of approximate models as possibly true. 
The objective is to choose a maxmin strategy that will work under a range of different model specifications. 
This is done by dynamic programming techniques. 
Under relatively weak conditions we show that there is a solution to the optimality equation for the maxmin control problem as well as an optimal strategy for the controller. 
These results are applied to the theory of optimal growth and the Hansen-Sargent robust control model in macroeconomics. 
We also study a class of zero-sum discounted stochastic games with unbounded payoffs and simultaneous moves and give a brief overview of recent results on stochastic games with weakly continuous transitions and the limiting average payoffs.
Let _MATH_ denote the value of the maximum cut problem for _MATH_. 
We have _MATH_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are determined by the following table _MATHDISP_ Moreover _MATH_ so the percentage error of approximating the maxcut by its upper bound is asymptotically zero on the infinite families.
On the basis of the two local tracks of lidar and radar, _MATH_ and _MATH_, we can yield the corresponding relation between the two local tracks. 
The distance function is defined as _CITE_ _CITE_ _MATHDISP_.
In this paper, the dissipativity of a class of cellular neural networks with proportional delays is considered. 
By using inner product properties and matrix theory, two new delay-independent sufficient conditions are derived for the dissipativity of the system, which might have an impact in the studying the stability, instability and the existence of periodic solutions. 
It can be shown that the derived criteria are less conservative than previously existing results through the numerical examples and their simulation results. 
The dissipativity criterion is also suitable for Hopfield neural networks with proportional delays in the paper.
Similar to the median filter the kernel is centered above the pixel position whose value we are calculating. 
We denote this center _MATH_ in the kernel coordinate system and the kernel as _MATH_, see figure _REF_. 
To calculate the output value we take the value of _MATH_ and multiply it by the pixel value beneath. 
Let's say that we are calculating the output value of the pixel at position _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ will be above the pixel _MATH_ and the value of these two pixels are multiplied together. 
The result is added to the product of the next kernel element _MATH_ and the pixel value beneath _MATH_, etc. 
The final value which will be written into the the output image as _MATH_ is found as: _MATHDISP_
We present a general method how to prove convergence of a sequence of random variables generated by a nonautonomous scheme of the form _MATH_, where _MATH_ represent randomness, used as an approximation of the set of solutions of the global optimization problem with a continuous cost function. 
Later we show some of its applications.
Adding the contributions in the four cases, the sum of the signs of the permutations fixed by the involution is _MATHDISP_, which agrees with the right hand side of _REF_ when all the parts of _MATH_ have odd size. 
Formula _REF_ also holds when _MATH_. 
The only change in the argument is that there are no permutations in case (iii), but in case (iv), when choosing the index _MATH_ such that _MATH_ equals _MATH_ or _MATH_, the choice _MATH_ forces _MATH_, giving _MATH_ choices for the underlined pair, times _MATH_ choices for the remaining entries of _MATH_.
In the following, we compute the average number of paths passing through each edge in _MATH_. 
The total number of paths is _MATH_. 
Also, since any connected pair in _MATH_ are within distance _MATH_ of each other and the side length of the bins is _MATH_, there are _MATH_ bins intersecting a straight line joining a pair _MATH_. 
Consequently, each path contains _MATH_ edges. 
The total number of bins is _MATH_. 
Hence, by symmetry, the number of paths passing through each bin is _MATH_. 
Consider a particular bin _MATH_ and the paths passing through it. 
All these paths are equally likely to choose any of the nodes in _MATH_. 
Therefore, the average number of paths containing a particular node in _MATH_, say _MATH_, is _MATH_. 
In addition, the average number of edges between _MATH_ and neighboring bins is _MATH_. 
Due to symmetry, the average number of paths containing an edge incident on _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
Since this is true for all nodes _MATH_, the average number of paths containing an edge is _MATH_.
We have considered the fidelity of a teleportation scheme with beam splittings. 
We showed that as the parameter _MATH_ goes to infinity the fidelity approaches unity and the teleportation scheme also approaches a perfect scheme as the teleportation scheme with tests does. 
In fact the fidelity can be bounded from below by square route of probability to complete successful teleportation with tests.
We first consider the setup Gunn is using, and its translation into the CGA.
The effect of matrix cracks in the whole blade on changes in the tip lag (_MATH_), flap (_MATH_) and torsion (_MATH_) response for varying crack density are shown in Fig. _REF_.
If there exists one solution (_MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_) of the BSDEs given by (_MATH_, _MATH_) such that the sequence (_MATH_)_MATH_ is increasing, then the sequence (_MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_) converges to (_MATH_) in the sense that _MATHDISP_, and the triple (_MATH_) solves the BSDE(_MATH_, _MATH_) of type (_REF_). 
The "stability" result stated in Lemma _REF_ holds also for the solution of the BSDE(_MATH_) of type (_REF_) (this results from the correspondence established in the second step).
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the stability and Hopf bifurcations of system _REF_. 
As pointed out in _CITE_, works on the analysis of such a system would face a general characteristic equation with delay dependent parameters due to the coefficient of system including the delay _MATH_. 
Therefore, the stability and bifurcation analysis is very complicated by regarding communication delay _MATH_ as a bifurcation parameter. 
Based on this fact, we will use the gain parameter _MATH_ instead of the delay _MATH_ as the bifurcation parameter to get the Hopf bifurcation including its direction and stability. 
The main tools applied to get our results are the normal form method and the center manifold theory introduced by Hassard _CITE_.
RPC-based application or server programs are coded in a programming style very similar to certain kinds of non-distributed programs, namely those written to interact through some form of graphical user interface (GUI). 
There is no explicit use of message passing, and the program is structured to register a variety of "callback" procedures, which will be invoked by the runtime system as events occur and need to be handled (this is a familiar model for anyone who has written a program using a standard GUI package). 
However, there is an important aspect of RPC programming that differs from programming with local procedure calls: the separation of the service interface definition, or IDL, from the code that implements it. 
In an RPC application, a service is considered to have two parts. 
The interface definition specifies the way that the service can be located (its name), the data types used in issuing requests to it, and the procedure calls that it supports. 
A version number is included to provide for evolution of the service over time-the idea being that if a client is developed to use version 1.1 of a service, there should be a way to check for compatibility if it turns out that version 1.0 or 2.3 is running when the client actually gets executed. 
These checks are often automated, and in some systems (notably the Microsoft .NET environment) there are mechanisms for automatically downloading versions of services needed by an application, and even for running two different versions of the same service side-by-side in support of a set of clients having varied requirements.
The resolution of our measurements was sufficient to allow the determination of the strength of individual lines with different rotational quantum number. 
Figure _REF_ (solid black squares) shows a Boltzmann plot of rotational states in OH A _MATH_(J). 
For a thermal distribution, a straight line would be expected with the slope being the product of the Boltzmann constant _MATH_ and the flame temperature _MATH_. 
Figure _REF_ shows, that this is not the case for the observed OH_MATH_ states. 
The curve roughly falls into two parts: One with a comparatively small slope at low rotational quantum numbers and a significantly steeper one for high quantum numbers. 
Therefore, the observed OH_MATH_ spectrum cannot be described by a thermal distribution and it seems, that the rotational states are not in equilibrium.
The kinematics of the clump _MATH_ is not strongly affected by freeze out on grain surfaces, it is a good tracer of younger cold and massive cloud cores. 
_MATH_ is a highly abundant molecule, with abundance especially enhanced around regions of higher fractional ionization. it is also enhanced by the presence of outflows where shock-generated radiation fields are present (Vasyunina et al. _CITE_). 
_MATH_ molecules are formed in the icy mantles of interstellar dust grains by hydrogenation of CO molecules at temperature of 10K, as the young protostellar object evolve and warm up its environment the _MATH_ molecule sublimate from the dust grains into the gas phase at 100K (Torstensson _CITE_). 
Detection of _MATH_ and _MATH_ toward the high-mass clump indicates that one hot core has formed around the YSO N10-7. 
On the other hand, detection of _MATH_ indicates star formation in the clump is still in its early stage, the natal molecular cloud was not destroyed by the feedback of YSO (see Fig. 3).
Following the definition of the infinitesimal generator as in Section _REF_, Eq. (_REF_), it is not difficult to show that (_REF_) is the infinitesimal generator of _MATH_, with _MATH_ satisfying (_REF_). 
For that, we define the semigroup _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
See, for instance, _CITE_ for more details.
Even if the operator _MATH_ may enjoy neither bounded purely imaginary powers nor a bounded _MATH_ functional calculus in _MATH_, one can prove some analogous weak results as Theorems _REF_ and _REF_. 
In fact, under _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_, it is possible to verified that _MATHDISP_ with continuous embeddings.
This means that the theory predicts the existence of superposition states and the highly non classical interference effects also for macro objects which, of course, are not usually observed in our everyday life.
When both electrons and ions are modeled by an anisotropic distribution of bi-Kappa type, _CITE_ have derived the general dispersion relation for the parallel electromagnetic modes, right-handed (R mode) and left-handed (L mode) circularly polarized, in terms of the modified plasma dispersion function (_REF_). 
The effect of suprathermal particles on the stability of these modes largely varies depending on the shape of the distribution function, and the mode frequency, whether it fits to thermal Doppler shift of the electron gyrofrequency (the whistler instability driven by the cyclotron resonance with electrons) or the ion gyrofrequency (the electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability). 
Thus, while the growth rates of the electron-cyclotron instability (R-mode lower branch, _MATH_) become lower in a bi-Kappa plasma than for a bi-Maxwellian with the same temperature anisotropy _CITE_, also see Fig. _REF_, b, at smaller frequencies (_MATH_), the whistler growth rates become higher _CITE_. 
_CITE_ have also shown that, unlike a bi-Maxwellian plasma, the low-frequency whistler modes in a Maxwellian-Kappa plasma (described above), can be stable to the temperature anisotropy. 
Their study includes effects of varying _MATH_ for both underdense and overdense plasmas, and for both parallel and oblique propagation.
By Lemma _REF_ and Propositions _REF_ and _REF_, for any _MATH_ in _MATH_, each of the branches of the trisector is monotonic with respect to either the _MATH_ or the _MATH_-direction, but not both. 
Furthermore, the set of _MATH_ for which each branch is monotonic with respect to the _MATH_-direction (resp. the _MATH_-direction) is closed (since the lines and _MATH_ vary continuously in terms of _MATH_). 
Hence, each branch of the trisector is monotonic in _MATH_ for all _MATH_ or is monotonic in _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Therefore, by exchanging, if needed, _MATH_ and _MATH_ in all frames _MATH_, we may suppose that each of the four branches of the trisector of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ is monotonic with respect to the _MATH_-direction.
In contrast to the existing literature considering earnings risk, this analysis acknowledges that after-tax income is relevant for the decision to acquire tertiary education and takes taxation explicitly into account. 
Both the incentive effect of taxation - through its impact on the earnings differential between graduate and non-graduate career paths - and the risk-sharing effect - through its impact on earnings risk in the two alternatives - can be analyzed simultaneously. 
This method allows us to apply the estimated structural model to simulate the effect of tax policy reforms on university enrollment.
Taking into account the modified budget constraints, we can derive the following two first order conditions _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, it follows out of _REF_-_REF_ considering _REF_-_REF_ and _REF_-_REF_ _MATHDISP_. 
Equation _REF_ implies for _MATH_, _MATH_ that _MATH_. 
Since Eqs. _REF_ and _REF_ imply that _MATH_, the undersupply will be reduced for an increased labor market share. 
Therefore, it follows out of Eq. _REF_ that _MATH_ must hold. 
Section 10.12 of the book deals with the numerical reconstruction of Jacobi matrices from spectral data; it refers to the theoretical background in Section 5.6. 
The authors report experimental results somewhat different from the literature. 
It might be interesting to investigate the sources of such differences in order to eliminate a possible influence of computer implementations.
This is the OSNR model typically used in optical links. 
Mathematically the OSNR model in (_REF_) is similar to the wireless signal to interference ratio (SIR) model _CITE_. 
However, it has a richer system structure: _MATH_ with _MATH_ defined in (_REF_) is a full matrix, with cross-coupling terms, non-zero diagonal elements and all elements dependent on network parameters (e.g., the gain and ASE noise of optical amplifiers). 
We can rewrite (_REF_) as _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Hence OSNR is no longer a linear function of channel input power like SIR as in _CITE_. 
Furthermore, since optical amplifiers are often cascaded along the link, ASE noise accumulates over many amplifiers and degrades channel OSNR as the number of amplifiers increases, which is reflected by (_REF_).
The aim of the paper is to analyze the allocation and welfare effects of a coordinated reform that reduces payroll taxes and increases progressive wage taxes. 
Rather than focusing on revenue-neutral tax reforms, as is common in the public economics literature, we consider a strategy of keeping the marginal tax wedge constant. 
Our approach allows us to focus on the composition of the tax wedge and thus abstracts from the effects of a change in the level of the tax wedge. 
Besides being analytically convenient, this strategy is also practicable. 
Compared with a revenue-neutral restructuring - which requires an analysis of complex tax base effects - all that is needed is information on marginal tax rates.
In this paper, multifractal methods are used to analyze the distribution of magnetic flux in a number of evolving active regions observed using MDI. 
These observations are described in section 2. 
In section 3, the fractal and multifractal methods are discussed, while our results are given in section 4. 
Our conclusions and future directions are then given in section 5.
We assume equal priors; _MATH_ for _MATH_urban, rural} prior to any measurement computation. 
Label probabilities are then updated in a parallel-iterative fashion as: _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the _MATH_ estimate of the probability of label _MATH_ occurring at the adjacent region in the direction _MATH_. 
Similar to _MATH_, in our case _MATH_ is the same for all directions. 
The conditional label-pair probabilities _MATH_ were estimated manually from the same training data used earlier. 
The effect of Eq. _REF_ is to compute an adjustment to the probability of label _MATH_ on region _MATH_ according to the compatibilities and current estimates of label probabilities on neighboring regions. 
Eq. _REF_ renormalizes the label probabilities after all adjustments have been applied.
Let us first study the effect on the Doppler data of a constant anomalous acceleration _MATH_ acting on the probe. 
This case may correspond to an imperfectly modelled thermal radiation budget, a modification of gravity law in the first sector, or a linear combination of both effects (see eq._REF_). 
The discovery of the Pioneer anomaly by Anderson et al _CITE_, its confirmation by subsequent analysis _CITE_, just mean that the reduction of the Doppler data of the Pioneer probes is greatly improved by adding a non zero value of _MATH_ to the standard calculation of the Doppler observable. 
The best-fit value corresponds to a Sunward acceleration with a magnitude _MATHDISP_
In the case _MATH_ the proof can be simplified by applying Lemma 2 of Janssen and Pauly (2009) directly on (_REF_).
The path ordered exponential _MATHDISP_ is the Wilson line _CITE_. 
It may be possible to include final state interactions with the medium via modification of the Wilson lines in this definition of the non-equilibrium fragmentation function, similar to the _MATH_ distribution of the parton distribution function studied in _CITE_.
The dimensionless amplitude ratio _MATH_ is plotted in Fig. _REF_ over the frequency ratio _MATH_ for different values of damping ratio. 
For very low frequencies, the amplitude ratio is nearly zero since the unbalance forces are small. 
As the shaft speed increases, the amplitude shows a large peak near _MATH_ when _MATH_ is near the resonance frequency of the system. 
The amplitude ratio at the critical speed _MATH_ can be found from Eq. _REF_ to be, _MATHDISP_. 
When the damping ratio is small, the amplitude ratio increases rapidly near _MATH_ as the unbalance forces excite the rotor resonance mode. 
For larger values of _MATH_, the system is nearly critically damped, and only a little of the resonance is seen in the amplitude ratio plot. 
Finally, for _MATH_ the amplitude of vibration approaches 1.
This lemma implies, for each _MATH_, existence of a function _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ with the estimate _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, we obtain that _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, by _REF_, _MATH_. 
Consequently, _MATH_ with _MATH_.
Case 3:) Assume that the plant state switches from _MATH_ to _MATH_ and filter state remains in _MATH_, that is, _MATH_, then we obtain _MATHDISP_
The polarization of spikes is circular and in individual cases it is very large, although the average value is only 25 % _CITE_.
The starting time of a job indexed by a pair product _MATH_ - period _MATH_ is given by _MATH_. 
Therefore, the ILSS model defines production lots that can be actually produced in each period, since information on capacity utilization and changeover setup times are supported by a feasible scheduling in each period. 
For such purpose, variable _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, assumes value 1 if a job indexed by _MATH_ is assigned to machine _MATH_, and value 0 otherwise. 
Analogously, binary variable _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, assumes value 1 if two jobs indexed by pairs composed with products _MATH_ and _MATH_ - period _MATH_ are to be processed in machine _MATH_ and _MATH_ is to be processed first, and value 0 otherwise. 
The ILSS model is written as follows, where _MATH_. _MATHDISP_
Note that the processing time of job _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
This implies that no job of agent _MATH_ can be processed in the batch containing _MATH_ or completed after _MATH_ in the schedule _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
Hence we conclude with the following result:
It remains to construct the stiffness matrix _MATH_. 
The idea is to express the global basis functions _MATH_ in terms of the local shape functions. 
We have for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, we can assembly the matrix _MATH_ using the following summation _MATHDISP_. 
As for the stiffness matrix, we also decompose the load vector _MATH_ into elemental loads. 
For _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_, Using again the local shape function, we obtain for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
For general functions _MATH_ these integrals cannot be computed exactly and have to be approximated by a numerical quadrature rule. 
To assemble the global load vector _MATH_ we use, _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_ we have _MATH_, since _MATH_. 
Hence, we get _MATH_ degrees of freedom and the reduced matrices _MATH_, _MATH_ where the first and last rows and columns of _MATH_ in (_REF_) are omitted. 
Similar considerations can be made for the vector _MATH_. 
If we have non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition, _MATH_, _MATH_ for given functions _MATH_, _MATH_, we write _MATH_, where the function _MATH_ satisfies the boundary conditions, _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Now, _MATH_ has again homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and is the solution of _MATHDISP_. 
Choosing _MATH_, we obtain the matrix form _MATHDISP_, where the load vector _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ denoting the coefficient vector of _MATH_. 
For Neumann boundary conditions, i.e., _MATH_, _MATH_, the boundary degrees of freedom must be kept.
In addition to the psychology experiment to compare the effects of mediated touch with real touch, we conducted a user survey. 
The purpose of the user survey is to gather user feedback on Huggy Pajama to investigate usability problems and also to guide future design of our system. 
In our survey, ten (10) pairs of participants of parent-child relation were engaged. 
The verbal and behavioral feedback from the user sessions were analyzed to acquire a detailed understanding of the needs, wants and tasks expected of Huggy Pajama. 
The main methods of our approach used here are through observation, survey questionnaire and interview.
The effects of training noise on the minimum success rates for different measurement data sets at various (testing) noise levels are shown in Table _REF_. 
The minimum success rate gives an indication of the reliability of the genetic fuzzy system. 
From Table _REF_ it is observed that, the highest values of _MATH_ and _MATH_ for minimum success rate with displacement based measurement deltas are about 16.1 and 11.4, respectively. 
This result indicates that the training noise level of 0.15 is a good option for the genetic fuzzy system with the displacement based measurement delta. 
The highest value of _MATH_ for minimum success rate with the force based measurement deltas is about -3.20 and the highest value of _MATH_ is 14.2. 
This shows that for the force based measurement delta, a training noise level of 0.05 is a good option. 
The highest value of _MATH_ for minimum success rate with moment based measurement delta is about 4.90 and the highest value of _MATH_ is 4.80. 
This shows that for the moment based measurement delta, a training noise level of 0.15 is a good option. 
The highest value of _MATH_ for minimum success rate with all measurement deltas together is about -2.70 and the highest value of _MATH_ is 0.02. 
This shows that for the all measurement deltas, a training noise level of 0.05 is a good option.
Let _MATH_ be the set of _MATH_-memory common sub-Nash equilibriums with tolerance _MATH_. 
Construct _MATHDISP_ with _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ is a strategy of _MATH_-memory common sub-Nash equilibrium of _MATH_, then the tolerance of _MATH_, denoted by _MATH_, satisfies _MATHDISP_.
Dark solitons represent intensity dips on an otherwise stable uniform background, where the phase has a _MATH_ jump in the center of the structure _CITE_. 
We focus our attention on two fundamental discrete dark solitons: on-site solitons, given by (...,1,1,1,0,-1,-1,-1,...) and inter-site ones, which have the following amplitude pattern (...,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,...), see Fig. 2 of Ref. _CITE_.
Traffic demand _MATH_ is distributed on links according to the cost vectors _MATH_ and _MATH_; in particular, the relationships between _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the path choice probability matrix, also known as path choice map of dimensions (_MATH_, _MATH_). 
Each element _MATH_ of _MATH_ expresses the probability that traffic demand _MATH_ (of the _MATH_-th _MATH_-couplepair) is routed on path _MATH_; its value is zero when path _MATH_ does not start in _MATH_ or does not end in _MATH_. 
Its value depends on the cost of traveling on path _MATH_ and its functional form can vary according to the distribution of the cost itself (two possible examples are shown in Equations _REF_ and _REF_). 
The equilibrium solutions _MATH_ and _MATH_, for Equation _REF_ and _REF_ can be written as: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
(II) The relations between period of the bifurcating periodic orbits and varying delay _MATH_: 
In this part, we take _MATH_ close to the minimal bifurcation value _MATH_ of the corresponding system _REF_ for different parameters _MATH_. 
Hence, _MATH_ is changed when any other parameter is changed. 
For system _REF_ with parameters _MATH_ satisfying condition _REF_, we found that increasing _MATH_ could result in decreasing _MATH_ and increasing period of the family of bifurcating periodic orbits; and increasing _MATH_ could lead to increasing _MATH_ and decreasing period of the family of bifurcating periodic orbits in bifurcation formulas and our numerical observation. 
Hence, the effect from _MATH_ and _MATH_ on period for system _REF_ is similar to the one for system _REF_. 
However, different to system _REF_, for system _REF_, if we increase the ratio _MATH_ by changing _MATH_ and _MATH_ simultaneously, then system _REF_ has a family of stable periodic orbits with decreasing _MATH_. 
Hence, in formula _REF_ and our numerical simulation, the family of bifurcating periodic orbits at _MATH_ has increasing period as _MATH_ increases.
Nonnegative initial data for _MATH_ and _MATH_ must be prescribed on _MATH_ but only _MATH_ need be prescribed. 
Initial data for _MATH_ is constrained by that of _MATH_ and _MATH_ because _MATHDISP_ (see _CITE_). 
The integral captures all cells infected from _MATH_ to _MATH_ which have not washed out of the chemostat.
On the other hand, we attain the following inequality from Lemma 2 _MATHDISP_
Of course the reionization is very likely a very prolonged affair, with some arguments suggesting that it might start as early as redshift 80 (Biermann &amp; Kusenko 2006), then initiated by massive stars. 
How the first stars may have formed, has been reviewed by Ripamonti &amp; Abel (2005).
There has also been work done on making the ICP more robust towards erroneous data, cf. _CITE_, and choosing weighting schemes to better depict the reliability of the different parts of the mesh cf. _CITE_.
For _MATH_, take _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, take _MATH_ as an _MATH_-semi-period for the function _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
Then we have: _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_, given _MATH_ as an _MATH_-semi-period of _MATH_, we have for all _MATH_: _MATHDISP_.
As a result, each vertex _MATH_ of the union _MATH_ is the intersection point of either (i) three cylinder boundaries, (ii) a pair of cylinder boundaries and one spherical boundary, (iii) a cylinder boundary and a pair of spherical boundaries, or (iv) three spherical boundaries. 
We refer to each of these vertices as being of type CCC, CCS, CSS, or SSS, respectively. 
Vertices that are obtained by the intersection of the circle separating the cylindrical and spherical portions of one cigar, and the boundary of another cigar are discarded from further consideration, as the overall number of such vertices in the entire arrangement is _MATH_. 
In the analysis of _CITE_, these four cases are handled separately, however, using our new approach, we show that all these cases can be analyzed simultaneously. 
Note that in the SSS-case, each vertex _MATH_ of the union lies on the boundary of the union of three distinct spheres, and thus the problem is reduced in this case to bounding the complexity of the union of _MATH_ balls in 3-space, which is known to be _MATH_ (see, e.g., _CITE_), however, this case is subsumed by our analysis.
In _CITE_ a quartic formulation of the StQP has been proposed, which uses the substitution _MATH_, to get rid of the sign constraints _MATH_. 
Then the condition _MATH_ reads _MATH_, and we get the following ball constrained quartic problem _MATHDISP_ where we denote by _MATH_ the diagonal matrix with elements _MATH_.
The pair of companion papers _CITE_ and _CITE_ address the statistical analysis of antenna properties operated on intermediate quantities (e.g. antenna mode amplitudes) which contain all the specificities of antenna radiation in a compact way, rather than on the output quantities of interest themselves. 
The method exploits parametric modelling based on SMEM combined with the SEM _CITE_. 
These techniques allow a very high compression rate of the amount of data necessary to express accurately the antenna radiation over a large frequency range, after proper truncation of the unnecessary modes. 
Owing to this high compression, a statistical analysis of a database of antennas may be performed on the intermediate parameters, which are the poles (natural frequency and damping factor) and the modal residues. 
In _CITE_, this approach has been tested on a class of three kinds of UWB planar antennas, of different designs but having common major features. 
Several geometrical parameters of each design have been randomly changed according to relevant rules (Fig. _REF_) and the statistics of the most significant intermediate parameters have been determined. 
They were generally found to be Gaussian distributed (Fig. _REF_).
To enforce the model in (_REF_) and (_REF_) to be covariance stationary, the standard approach is to use a set of sufficient conditions through parameter restrictions. 
For this type of model, a set of restrictions are given in (_REF_)-(_REF_), and for the autoregressive part of the model: _MATHDISP_. 
See e.g. Silberberg and Pafka (2001) or Chen et al (2005). 
We must also have positive definite conditional covariance matrices for each time point, however there are no known conditions on parameters that guarantee p.d. for VECH models.
The CGC is a systematic cyclic variation with a period of about 90 to 100 years which has been present for about 80% of the time during the last 1 500 years. 
It consists of a set of about eight eleven-year solar cycles. 
The amplitude of the eleven-year cycles varies approximately as a sign function and the sunspot number returns to nearly the same low value at each eleven-year cycle minimum. 
During the minima of each eleven-year sunspot cycle the intensity of the galactic cosmic rays, the number of aurora seen at mid-latitudes and the geomagnetic activity vary approximately like the amplitude of the 11-year solar cycles that make up the CGCs. 
The minimum of the CGC cycle is a period of several years when galactic cosmic rays fluxes are high, mid-latitude aurora are very rare but high latitude aurora are common.
First, since the random variable _MATH_ is conditionally Gaussian, the conditional third moment _MATH_ of _MATH_ with respect to observations, which stands in the last term of the equation (8), is equal to zero, because the process _MATH_ is conditionally Gaussian. 
Thus, the entire last term in (8) is vanished and the following variance equation is obtained _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ with the initial condition _MATH_.
The Higgs sector of the MSSM is that of a type-II 2HDM discussed in section _REF_, but with a much more restricted parameter space. 
In the MSSM the masses of the neutral Higgs bosons and the mixing angle _MATH_ are no longer independent parameters. 
At tree level they can be expressed in terms of the pseudoscalar Higgs-boson mass _MATH_ and _MATH_ as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
For MSSM scenarios with _MATH_ these equations yield _MATHDISP_. 
However, it is well-known that the tree-level relations _REF_ are substantially modified by loop corrections to the MSSM Higgs potential. 
These corrections are responsible for pushing the mass of the light Higgs boson substantially above the _MATH_-boson mass and have to be taken into account to obtain reliable results. 
In our scans we used FeynHiggs 2.6.5 _CITE_ to calculate all one-loop and leading two-loop corrections to the neutral Higgs-boson self-energies in the MSSM and to extract from them the physical neutral Higgs-boson masses, LSZ residues, and the resulting effective mixing angle _MATH_. 
We also use FeynHiggs for the calculation of the total Higgs-boson decay widths.
By differentiating relation (_REF_) with respect to _MATH_ at _MATH_ and using _MATH_, one concludes that for the free scalar field theory _MATHDISP_, i.e. the defining equation for the propagator whose solution reads _MATHDISP_. 
For the interacting theory, differentiation of relation (_REF_) with respect to _MATH_ at _MATH_ yields _MATHDISP_. 
We may then apply the Gell-Mann-Low formula _MATHDISP_, and make use of Wick contractions for free asymptotic fields: _MATHDISP_. 
To first order in the coupling constant, expression (_REF_) then reads _MATHDISP_, where the subscript _MATH_ means that we only consider the connected parts (the non-connected contributions being compensated by the denominator in (_REF_)). 
By using Wick contractions expression (_REF_) becomes _MATHDISP_. 
At order 0 in _MATH_, we recover relation (_REF_). 
At first order in _MATH_, we obtain the result _MATHDISP_, which may be interpreted graphically by: _MATHDISP_
Incorporation of an acoustic echo canceller is a necessity for designing a communication channel or establishing a conference room environment. 
In dual channel communication systems, the adaptive filter algorithms are mostly employed for acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) _CITE_-_CITE_. 
The adaptive filter algorithm based AEC techniques require, by default, two separate channels - one for receiving echo corrupted signal and the other for the reference signal. 
In the AEC systems employed in communication channels or multi-path systems, the near-end signal, which is available at hand, is fed to the adaptive filter as a reference to cancel the far-end echoed signal _CITE_. 
Here, the room acoustic response parameters are updated adaptively to produce an estimate of echo. 
Among different adaptive filter algorithms, the gradient based least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and its modifications, such as normalized LMS (NLMS) and variable step size LMS (VLMS) algorithms are widely used for their satisfactory performances, less computational burden and ease of implementation _CITE_, _CITE_ _CITE_. 
Besides these algorithms, the recursive least mean squares (RLS) algorithm is well-known for its fast convergence at the expense of computational complexity _CITE_. 
Several sophisticated control mechanisms have been proposed for fast and robust adaptation of the adaptive filter coefficients in realistic acoustic environments _CITE_, _CITE_ _CITE_. 
In addition, some authors proposed stereophonic techniques for dual or single channel AEC based on adaptive filtering _CITE_ _CITE_ while some other incorporated frequency domain techniques as well _CITE_. 
In real life echo generating scenario, environmental noise may be present and therefore, single channel noise reduction techniques such as spectral subtraction for white noise or colored noise _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_ are sometime incorporated in the system following the acoustic echo canceller to handle environmental noise.
The controller settings are then no longer adequate and the loop may become under-damped or too sluggish.
Let _MATH_ be a _MATH_ matrix satisfying the condition that _MATH_. 
Premultiplying _REF_ by _MATH_ yields _MATHDISP_. 
Equation _REF_ no longer involves _MATH_. 
The issue of whether _MATH_ is correlated with _MATH_ or whether _MATH_ should be treated as fixed or random is no longer relevant for _REF_. 
Moreover, since _MATH_ is exogenous, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
An efficient estimator of _MATH_ is the generalized least squares estimator (GLS), _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_- denotes the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse _CITE_.
Inequalities for periodic solutions of first-order functional differential equations are obtained. 
These inequalities are the best possible in a certain sense.
Let _MATH_ be a ribbon. 
Such a ribbon is said to be _MATH_-addable and _MATH_-removable. 
Its height _MATH_ is defined as the number of lines it occupies minus one, and its sign is then _MATH_. 
The bottom left cell of _MATH_ is its tail, and the top right one is its head. 
Given a partition _MATH_, the ribbons that can be removed or added to _MATH_ are entirely determined by the coordinates of their heads and tails. 
On Figure _REF_ are two ribbons: the left one has size 4, height 2 and sign _MATH_, and the right one has size 6, height 1 and thus sign _MATH_.
In the top panel of their Figure 5, Robbins, Henney, and Harvey _CITE_ compared the observed and "predicted" values of the solar wind speed for a 54-day interval in the declining stage of the solar cycle 22. 
This interval is considered as good for forecasting, and the average _MATH_ difference is found to be around 10%. 
However, inspecting the peak values in the graph, one finds that during the two main HSS intervals the predicted peak values range around 550 km s_MATH_, whereas the observed speeds achieve values around 650 km s_MATH_. 
That gives the value of _MATH_ in the range 15-20% for two out of three velocity peaks present in the considered interval. 
In comparison, our procedure resulted in _MATH_% only in one out of eleven peaks (see Table III). 
Since our _MATH_ forecasting expression is quite similar to the one used by Robbins, Henney, and Harvey _CITE_, this might indicate that the determination of the CH areas by using SXI data offers better predictions than by using He I 1083 nm spectroheliograms. 
However, to draw a definite conclusion, a direct comparison of the same time interval would be necessary, preferably covering various phases of solar cycle (e.g., one method could be superior in one phase, but inferior in another). 
Similar holds for the comparison with more sophisticated methods of solar wind forecasting that are based on the magnetostatic potential field source surface modeling (e.g., Arge and Pizzo, _CITE_; Arge et al., _CITE_, and reference therein).
In the isotropic case we found (see Section 2.4) _MATHDISP_.
The construction of the DoE first requires identifying the spatial structure of the data that characterizes the kriging model. 
This identification is performed with the statistical SUNSET software developped by IRSN (_CITE_). 
It is based on the estimation, once and for all from the initial data, of the experimental semi-variogram provided by Eq. (_REF_) and displayed by the cross signs on Fig. _REF_, top, right. 
It clearly indicates a spatial dependence that decreases with respect to the distance. 
Two theoretical semi-variogram models (Gaussian and exponential) have been tested to represent this spatial structure and their parameters have been estimated by average least square method. 
The selection of the model has been performed by cross-validation (_CITE_) and an exponential model of parameters _MATH_ has been identified (Fig. _REF_, top,right, solid line). 
The criteria to optimize is constructed from the combination between the kriging estimation variance and the population density. 
This density comes from the IGN geographic data base BD CARTO¬Æ_MATH_and has been projected on a uniform grid with a space step of _MATH_. 
It corresponds to _MATH_ points. 
To avoid reducing the information related to the population density, this fine grid is used to estimate _MATH_.
A theoretical study of how the slow mode, under solar coronal conditions, can be derived from the MHD equations has been carried out by, e.g. _CITE_. 
The magnetic field was assumed straight in the vertical direction in a gravitationally stratified medium. 
This theory has been applied to the slow waves in coronal loops observed by SUMER and TRACE. 
_CITE_ generalised the model to include both magnetic and density stratification, i.e. taking into account the strongly expanding nature of loops that support MHD waves.
Moving on to the standing sausage modes pertinent to static slabs, Figure _REF_ examines the dependence on the slab aspect ratio _MATH_ of the period ratios _MATH_ with _MATH_ being up to four. 
It can be seen that the profile-associated difference in _MATH_ is more pronounced than for standing kink modes, with the step-function profile corresponding to lower _MATH_. 
This difference decreases with increasing _MATH_. 
The fractional change in _MATH_ for the step-function profile relative to the Epstein one is found to be up to _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ for _MATH_, and 4, respectively. 
In this regard, one would have to measure the periods with an accuracy of better than _MATH_ to tell which profile better describes the density structuring. 
One further notes that at this density contrast, _MATH_ for both profiles remains substantially larger than _MATH_, the expected lower bound as given by Equation (_REF_). 
On the other hand, one can see that the cutoff aspect ratios _MATH_ associated with the two profiles are not significantly different, reading _MATH_ (_MATH_) for the Epstein (step-function) profile. 
Actually, analytically expected values for these, Equations (_REF_) and (_REF_), yield that the ratio between the two is _MATH_.
Let us consider the flat FRW universe filled with the dark energy (_REF_) and the pressureless matter. 
In the MD epoch, the energy conservation equation of the matter, Eq.(_REF_), tells us _MATH_. 
Substituting this into Eq.(_REF_), we have _MATH_. 
Then Eq.(_REF_) tells us that in the MD epoch, _MATH_. 
Then we know that the fractional energy density (_REF_) increases in the matter-dominated epoch and eventually, the dark energy (_REF_) becomes dominated. 
From Eqs.(_REF_), (_REF_), (_REF_) and the conservation equation _MATH_, we can easily get the EoS parameter as _MATHDISP_. 
In the DED epoch, since approximately _MATH_ and _MATH_, from Eq.(_REF_) we have _MATHDISP_. 
So, as the expansion of the universe, _MATH_ approaches _MATH_ and the dark energy (_REF_) mimics a cosmological constant. 
The above analysis makes us believe that qualitatively the dark energy (_REF_) is a reasonable model.
The control problem can be reformulated as follows: determine the control strategy associated with the introduction of the control law _MATH_ that leads the nonlinear system (_REF_) from a given initial state to a final state defined by _MATHDISP_. 
Here as in other known cases, we will used a linear feedback control coupled to a nonlinear system. 
To justify the use of linear feedback control for nonlinear systems, we have to answer the following two questions:
 Under which conditions a linear feedback control is effective for nonlinear systems?
 Which functional is supposed to be minimized through this optimal control?
Analogously, as before we will consider that the energy density _MATH_ is a standard scalar field _MATH_ and satisfied the continuity equation given by Eq.(_REF_). 
In this form, the square of the velocity _MATH_ of the scalar field considering Eqs.(_REF_) and (_REF_), becomes _MATHDISP_, where the constants _MATH_ and _MATH_ are defined by _MATHDISP_.
We recall that two relations _MATH_ and _MATH_ are union-compatible iff _MATH_, where for a given list (or tuple) of the attributes _MATH_, we denote the set _MATH_ by _MATH_, _MATH_, with the injective function _MATH_ which assign distinct names to each column of this relation. 
If a relation _MATH_ is obtained from a given relation _MATH_ by permutating its columns, then we tell that they are not equal (in set theoretic sense) but that they are equivalent. 
Notice that in the RDB theory the two equivalent relations are considered equal as well. 
In what follows, given any two lists (tuples), _MATH_ and _MATH_ their concatenation _MATH_ is denoted by _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the symbol for concatenation of the lists. 
By _MATH_ we denote the extension of a given relation (relational symbol) _MATH_; it is extended to any term _MATH_ of Codd's algebra, so that _MATH_ is the relation obtained by computation of this term. 
Let us briefly define these basic operators, and their correspondence with the formulae of FOL:
Proof. 
If _MATH_, then _MATH_. 
Hence, _MATHDISP_. 
First we shall show that _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_, there exists _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
For every _MATH_, we have by Doob's maximal inequality and (_REF_) that _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Using Lemma 3.4 by taking _MATH_, we get _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ are constants. 
Hence _MATHDISP_. 
Choose _MATH_ such that _MATH_, i.e., _MATH_, this proves (_REF_).
Notation: 
Throughout this paper, _MATH_ denotes the _MATH_-dimensional Euclidean space. 
The notation _MATH_ means that the matrix _MATH_ is real symmetric and positive definite (semidefinite). 
_MATH_ represents the identity matrix of the appropriate dimensions. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the largest and the smallest eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix _MATH_, respectively. 
For a real matrix _MATH_ and two real symmetric matrices _MATH_ and _MATH_ of appropriate dimensions, _MATH_ denotes a real symmetric matrix, where "*" denotes the entries implied by symmetry. _MATH_ denotes a diagonal matrix. 
_MATH_ denotes the Euclidean norm of the vector _MATH_. 
_MATH_, where _MATH_ _MATH_ is the gradient operators. 
Matrices, if their dimensions are not explicitly stated, are assumed to be compatible for algebraic operations. 
The mathematical expectation operator with respect to the given probability measure _MATH_ is denoted by _MATH_.
If we suppose that the state space _MATH_ is the motion group G and the process _MATH_ occurs for a discrete time set _MATH_, then the transition probability _MATH_ is the conditional probability for transition from primitive motion _MATH_ to primitive motion _MATH_. 
The transition matrix is given as _MATH_ (Fig. _REF_). 
Because the process _MATH_ is stochastic, the following conditions should be satisfied: _MATH_ 
According to the hypothesis in Section _REF_, _MATH_ has the following form: _MATHDISP_ 
Next, we discuss the realization of Markov chain _MATH_ and the calculation of the transition matrix _MATH_.
One of the necessary conditions for Chung's theorem to hold is that _MATH_ for each state _MATH_. 
However, _MATH_ for state _MATH_ here. 
It means if _MATH_, _MATH_ will not exist, which makes the necessary condition unsatisfied. 
In stating Claim 1 above, Heller used the words sufficiently large to avoid the conflict, but this interpretation is obviously too weak and lacks precision.
Assign longer length patterns to such NN's where the deviation is not large, by means of Equivalence Class Mapping
Summing up the above, _MATH_ satisfies all conditions of Theorem _REF_ . 
Hence _MATH_ possesses a critical value _MATH_, and hence problem (1.1) has at least one non-trivial weak solution. 
The proof is complete. 
There are a number of functions satisfying _MATH_ and _MATH_, for example, _MATH_. 
Next, we given two multiplicity results. 
Assume that _MATH_ and the following conditions are satisfied.
The blocked Gibbs sampler is a standard approach for implementing posterior computation for DPMs and the adaptation to structural equation models is straightforward. 
However, we include the detailed sampling steps here to make it easier to implement the proposed approach without needing to go through the algebra needed to calculate the conditional posterior distributions. 
Note the blocked Gibbs sampler relies on truncating the stick-breaking representation of the DP shown in (_REF_) by letting _MATH_, so that the _MATH_ terms in the sum can be discarded.
In summary, while a great many people use threads and RPC systems basically require threads, the bottom line is that surprisingly few people understand how to use threads correctly, a problem made quite a bit worse by the relatively awkward integration of RPC with threading. 
In modern multicore machines, where there can be performance benefits to using threads, we have a further pressure that only exaggerates the whole problem. 
The situation is a source of far more problems and bugs than is commonly recognized, and at least at the time of this writing, there seemed to be little reason to expect things to improve. 
Distributed programming simply demands a high degree of sophistication about threading and concurrency; we've now seen this in the case of RPC, but the same issue arises no matter what the style of program-to-program interaction!
In the same way as in (_REF_)-(_REF_), we obtain from (_REF_) that _MATHDISP_. for some constant _MATH_ which depends only on _MATH_, and _MATH_ (and the choice of _MATH_).
Remark _REF_(i) above together with Theorems _REF_-_REF_ and Proposition _REF_ provide a quite natural relationship between the subdifferential set _MATH_ and its part lying in the initial space, _MATH_. 
Indeed, it is well known that the set _MATH_ may in general be strictly larger than _MATH_; for example _CITE_, the conjugate of _MATH_ in _MATH_ is _MATH_, while _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ is Gteaux-differentiable at any _MATH_, with _MATH_ for all _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Nevertheless, our analysis shows that the set _MATH_ can be still recovered by a weak** closure procedure on subsets entering the expression of _MATH_. 
To put this in one picture, for instance Theorems _REF_ and Proposition _REF_ respectively give us _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, showing that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are built upon the same elements of the initial space _MATH_ but with closures invoking different topologies. 
So, the choice of the topology when taking the closure of the sets _MATH_ is decisive in the structure of _MATH_ : the norm topology gives us the set _MATH_, while the weak** topology provides us with the whole subdifferential set _MATH_. 
In other words, in order that the equality _MATH_ hold one needs to manage the intersection over the sets _MATH_. 
For example, according to Corollary _REF_, in the simple case when _MATH_ is finite and continuous at some point, with respect to a topology compatible with the duality pair _MATH_, we have that _MATHDISP_. 
Let us recall that when _MATH_, a characterization of (proper lsc convex) functions _MATH_ whose the conjugate satisfies the last relationship is given in _CITE_ by means of the behavior at 0 of the multifunction _MATH_.
From equation _MATH_, we can solve _MATH_, and obtain two values of _MATH_ as follows _MATHDISP_. 
Particularly, when _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ and when _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_.
We have studied the stability and stabilization problem for discrete impulsive switched system with norm-bounded parameter uncertainty and time variant delays. 
Based on Lyapunov Krasovskii technique and linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, we have established some delay-dependent criteria for ensuring asymptotic stability. 
Some numerical examples have been given to illustrate the results.
Now we introduce another generalization of the Ising model where one attaches a unit vector in a fixed plane to each lattice point. 
The unit vector points towards one of the corners of a planar equilateral _MATH_-gon, characterized by the angles _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ be the angle between the vectors at neighboring sites _MATH_ and _MATH_ a _MATH_-periodic function, then the energy function for the generalized _MATH_-model reads _MATHDISP_. 
Since the interaction only depends on the angle between vectors at neighboring sites it is invariant under the global _MATH_-transformations _MATHDISP_. 
The special choice _MATH_ leads us to the planar Potts model or clock model with energy function _MATHDISP_. 
Potts himself solved the two-dimensional model with _MATH_ and 4 states. 
The system with _MATH_ states is equivalent to the standard Potts model with _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
The planar Potts model with 4 states reduces to two standard Potts models with 2 states each. 
However, no relation between the standard and planar Potts models is known for _MATH_.
In this way the two-degree-of-freedom controller allows to achieve better nominal performance of the closed-loop system for a smaller magnitude of the control action. 
Both controllers, however, do not ensure robust stability and robust performance of the closed-loop system.
In our calculations, we take the temperature as _MATH_. 
We fix the GaAs well width as _MATH_ that corresponds to _MATH_ which is the number of layers in the well. 
The barriers are made of _MATH_ with an aluminium concentration of _MATH_ which corresponds to a barrier height _MATH_. 
In order to study the behavior of the saser emission, we varied the number of layers of both barriers. 
The following number of layers are considered, _MATH_. 
The corresponding electron currents and the saser intensities for each barrier width are shown in Fig. _REF_ and Fig. _REF_ respectively. 
In these graphs, we can see that the potential where the phonon emission is initiated and the width of the instability region increases as the number of layers in the barrier is increased. 
The electron current instability disappear for barriers smaller than twelve layers. 
The instability regions in the curve _MATH_ are characterized by the absence of stationary solutions of the electron current _MATH_ as a function of the external potential _MATH_.
Due to the arbitrary piecewise continuous differentiability of _MATH_, system (_REF_) accepts a unique solution under the assumption that _MATH_ is regular. 
Then obviously we have that _MATH_ is invertible and _MATH_ is a function of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Thus _MATH_ is continuously differentiable. 
We can obtain that _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are arbitrary piecewise continuously differentiable.
As has been mentioned, since Eq. (_REF_) satisfies the initial condition of Eq. (_REF_), it describes (in addition to Eq. (_REF_)), the set of enhanced diagrams, and gives the resulting Pomeron Green's function _MATHDISP_. 
Replacing the bare Pomeron Green's function by Eq. (_REF_), we can use Eq. (_REF_), Eq. (_REF_) and Eq. (_REF_), to calculate elastic and total cross sections.
The loss of HXR observations before HXR maximum encumbers our ability to conduct a realistic comparative analysis based on timing. 
Nevertheless, a simultaneous rise in the HXR flux with the 17 GHz and 34 GHz radio flux suggests that roughly the same particles, relativistic electrons, produce both the radio and HXR emission. 
The radio signature, attributed to gyro-synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, is highly impulsive, both at the onset and the ensuing decline phases.
SAPDS elegantly enables the owner to migrate their data to an un-trusted domain without compromising privacy. 
In addition, it enables the owner to a maintain fine-grained access control over the outsourced data even if they are not in command of the underlying computing resources and infrastructure. 
With SAPDS, it is possible for the data owner to revoke a particular user or a group of users, with _MATH_ complexity and without ever disseminating updating decryption key to the legitimate users by himself. 
Through the proposed scheme, owner delegates the key management task to the cloud server devoid of revealing any confidential information, which could impend the privacy of the outsourced data.
One topic in the tax competition literature is the impact of asymmetric jurisdiction size, especially on the choice of tax rates. 
_CITE_ and _CITE_ analyzed housing markets and derived the result of a higher tax rate at the core of a metropolitan area, than in its suburban areas. 
_CITE_ and _CITE_ analyzed the case of capital taxation, although it is limited to the case of two regions. 
The larger region sets a higher tax rate than the smaller region. 
The driving force is the greater market power of the central or larger city than that of the smaller ones. 
_CITE_ has already shown that the fiscal externality is determined by the reaction of the interest rate to a change in the regional tax rate. 
Hence a larger region can influence the interregional interest rate more than a small one and, therefore, the expected outflow of capital due to an increase in the tax rate will be lower in the large region, relative to its size, than that in a smaller region.
When _MATH_, the asymptotic approximation for the series _MATH_ is expressed by _MATHDISP_. 
Corresponding, the analytical formula for the series _MATH_ is expressed in the following form: _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_.
In this section, we propose three new centralized LA-based scheduling algorithms for solving the target coverage problem in WSNs. 
It is assumed that scheduling algorithms are pre-computed at the sink and the results are given to the sensors at the system initialization in order to determine when and for what duration the sensors should be activated _CITE_. 
The operation of network in the proposed algorithms is divided into several rounds. 
Each round, in turn, consists of three major steps, including (i) initialization, (ii) cover set formation, and (iii) monitoring. 
In the first step, a network of LA is constructed, and the action-set and action probability vectors of the LA are formed. 
In the second step, LA select a sub set of sensor nodes in order to construct a cover set. 
And in the final step, the constructed cover set is activated to monitor all the targets. 
In the following subsections, the problem is described and then the proposed solutions are presented in detail.
Our knowledge of the production, transport, and destruction of solar magnetic field by the solar dynamo is tested by solar cycle predictions. 
Models of the dynamo are validated by their ability to predict solar activity over short and long timescales. 
Predictions of the magnitude and timing of Solar Cycle 24 are also used by a variety of space weather groups to estimate orbital drag and other consequences of space weather in the upcoming cycle. 
Space weather operators use solar activity predictions to plan when to reboost satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO), anticipate radiation exposure for current and upcoming missions, and to plan for outages in radio-based communication and navigation systems. 
Space weather operators also want to know the significance of each prediction when compared to other predictions.
It should be noted that whenever the Lagrangian density of an _MATH_-th order gradient continuum is derived (not postulated phenomenologically), either by homogenization of an inhomogeneous continuum or continualization of a lattice, this density seems to contains the displacement derivatives of the order higher than _MATH_ _CITE_. 
The results of this paper suggest that these densities should not be used in formulating boundary value problems which require formulation of the natural boundary conditions. 
Another indirect but useful conclusion of this paper can be formulated as follows. 
When the equation of motion is taken as the starting point in the finite element formulation of a boundary-value problem _CITE_, one has to keep in mind that the natural boundary conditions cannot be derived uniquely unless certain symmetry requerements are employed to obtain a non-contradictory set of the boundary conditions.
To summarize, we believe that wave deceleration and its duration increase, both being the attributes of shock wave evolution, point out a crucial role of nonlinearity in the behavior of EUV and Moreton waves (at least, it concerns some of them).
Table _REF_ presents results for instances of scenarios 3 and 4, where aggregate capacity is equal to 6,720 minutes, corresponding to 4 machines times the 1,680 working minutes of a period. 
This is the case when lot sizing decisions are taken with the exact operation time of each resource. 
As in Table _REF_, we only report results for instances which the scheduling module cannot complete production lots generated by the pure lot sizing within certain periods, otherwise there is no increase in the total cost.
In recent years, the discrete epidemic dynamical models are widely investigated. 
The reasons are that the discrete models are more realistic than the continuous models in epidemic models since the epidemic statistics are compiled from given time intervals and not continuously. 
Such the discrete models not only study with good accuracy the behavior of the continuous models (see [1-3]), but also assess the effect of larger time steps. 
It is well known, for the discrete epidemic models, the main research subjects include the computation of the basic reproduction number, the local stability and global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium, the extinction, persistence and permanence of the disease, bifurcations and chaos phenomena of models, etc. 
Many important and interesting research works can be found in [4-29] and the references cited therein.
The use of the two partial spaces, rather than the full CGA, makes the construction of certain things more difficult, such as the Euclidean distance between two points, or the generalised angular momentum, but it appears the same information is present, albeit packaged in a different way. 
This would not apply in an obvious way to various other desirable features of the full CGA, such as ability to deal with the full conformal group, and to be able to construct and intersect geometric objects transcending simple lines and planes, however these lie outside what rigid body dynamics strictly needs.
Suppose that _MATH_ and _MATH_ are ranked posets of depth _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be a non-degenerate map. 
Then there is an induced map (functor) _MATH_ of the associated _MATH_-groupoids. 
Moreover, _MATH_ induces an inclusion map _MATH_ of the associated holonomy groups.
Due to the software design CWS is a state driven instrument. 
The different states, the possible state transitions, and the behavior of the software within each state are described below.
We use the following nonparametric test to answer these two questions: Choose _MATH_ additional 2-memory strategies randomly and add them to _MATH_ to form an extended set _MATH_. Find the sub-Nash equilibriums over _MATH_. 
Then we have the following results:
_AUTHOR_ Abstract: 
A nonlinear partial differential equation, which includes the Novikov equation as a special case, is investigated. 
The well-posedness of local strong solutions for the equation in the Sobolev space _MATH_ with _MATH_ is established. 
Although the _MATH_-norm of the solutions to the nonlinear model does not remain constants, the existence of its local weak solutions in the lower order Sobolev space _MATH_ with _MATH_ is established under the assumptions _MATH_ and _MATH_.
A comparison of the radiative ionization rates for five level hydrogen atoms with those caused by inelastic collisions with thermal electrons and by diffusive radiation formed by the action of radiative transfer, as shown in Figure _REF_ for levels two to five, reveals a dominant effect of diffusive emission in the lower chromosphere (column depths _MATH_) because of a decrease of the continuous opacity for each level.
As Langston remarked from a question of the first author: 
In transcriptomic, proteomic and other sort of -omics data we receive, the cliques are rarely exceedingly large. 
More importantly, these "real" graphs are typically sparse and nonregular. 
So the VC-FPT machine works quite well, at least as long as we do a lot of high performance computing and dynamic load balancing, etc.
_CITE_ Consider the autonomous system _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ be a continuously differentiable function. 
Assume that
 _MATH_, _MATH_;
 _MATH_ as _MATH_.
(in _MATH_ sense) of the Cauchy integral (_REF_), i.e. _MATHDISP_.
Proof of Proposition _REF_. 
Since _MATH_ is a consistent estimator of _MATH_ the convergence (_REF_) follows from Proposition _REF_ and Slutzky's Lemma. 
Moreover this implicates the asymptotic exactness of _MATH_. 
Hence it remains to investigate the behavior of _MATH_ for fixed variances _MATH_. 
For the denominator we get almost sure convergence _MATHDISP_ as _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ a.s. and _MATH_ holds we also have almost sure convergence _MATHDISP_ as _MATH_. 
This shows consistency of _MATH_. 
In contrast to the great majority of papers where the flat constant background is assumed, in the present paper we investigated the string in the coordinate dependent background. 
Unexpectedly, the effective theory obtained in this case, significantly differs from the one obtained in the flat background. 
Here, not only that the effective background is not constant, it cannot be described by the single effective coordinate _MATH_, but one needs the additional variable _MATH_. 
So, considering the problem of solving the boundary conditions in the curved background, the doubled space appears naturally. 
We also derived the equation of motion in the doubled space, which is nontrivial because variables _MATH_ and _MATH_ are not independent.
The same way as we obtained (_REF_), we compute: _MATHDISP_.
Assume that _MATH_ is Lipschitz continuous. 
Suppose we are given _MATH_ in _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
Consider the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem _MATHDISP_. 
Using the trace notion, we say that _MATH_ is a weak solution of this problem iff _MATHDISP_. 
Then problem _REF_ has a unique solution _MATH_ in _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is positive constant depending on _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_.
Mortimer and Eyring _CITE_ used an elementary transition state approach to obtain a simple model for Soret and Dufour effects in thermodynamically ideal mixtures of substances with molecules of nearly equal size. 
In their model the flow of heat in the Dufour effect was identified as the transport of the enthalpy change of activation as molecules diffuse. 
The results were found to fit the Onsager reciprocal relationship, Onsager _CITE_. 
Shariful et al. _CITE_ investigated the Dufour and Soret effects on steady combined free-forced convective and mass transfer flow past a semi-infinite vertical flat plate of hydrogen-air mixtures. 
They used the fourth order Runge-Kutta method to solve the governing equations of motion. 
Their study showed that the Dufour and Soret effects should not be neglected. 
Shateyi et al. _CITE_ investigated the effects of diffusion-thermo and thermal-diffusion on MHD fluid flow over a permeable vertical plate in the presence of radiation and hall current. 
Recently, Narayana et al. _CITE_ and Malashetty and Biradar _CITE_ have investigated the cross diffusion effects on the onset of double diffusive convection in a binary Maxwell fluid saturated porous medium. 
Other related recent studies on the effects of Soret and Dufour parameters include those by Makinde _CITE_.
In order to obtain an optimal schedule, we first create _MATH_ pure _MATH_-batches with processing times _MATH_ for each _MATH_. 
We call the procedure to get pure _MATH_-batches get-pure-batch. 
Then we enumerate all the possible full non-pure batching decisions for the remaining jobs. 
By Lemma 3.5, we may restrict our attention to schedules that have either zero or one full non-pure _MATH_-batch for each _MATH_. 
Therefore we need to consider _MATH_ possible combinations. 
We represent a given combination of full non-pure batches by the set of indices _MATH_, where _MATH_ if and only if there is a full non-pure _MATH_-batch. 
For a given set _MATH_, where _MATH_, we can get the full non-pure batches in _MATH_ time by the following full-batch-filling procedure:
A different type of estimators for the extreme value index that explicitly uses these second order conditions are discussed in Section 4.5 of Beirlant et al. (2004). 
These estimators typically have a smaller bias in the more restrictive model, but their consistency is not ensured if only condition _REF_ or _REF_ is assumed.
Let _MATH_ be a vertex transitive graph, and suppose _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, then there exists a constant _MATH_ such that the following holds. 
Let _MATH_ be an injective mapping and define _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_. 
Suppose that _MATH_ is such that for every _MATH_, there exists a vertical edge _MATH_ which satisfies _MATH_. 
Then there exists a horizontal edge _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
Having assumed that the distance between successive pairs of layers grows monotonically, we can avoid to perform further computations for the rejected points because we are guaranteed that the eventual distance of their descriptors from _MATH_ exceeds the dissimilarity threshold. 
Note that, in order to be efficient, the Fast Reject schema does not require onion descriptors to be incrementally defined. 
Nevertheless, in case of incrementally-defined descriptors the schema has a further advantage because the computation of each layer can exploit the previous layers as they are, without the need to re-compute them.
Show that if _MATH_ is a diffeomorphism and _MATH_ is a one-parameter group of transformations on _MATH_ whose infinitesimal generator is _MATH_, then, _MATH_ is a one-parameter group of transformations on _MATH_ whose infinitesimal generator is _MATH_ (cf. Exercise _REF_).
Compare the numerical observations of systems _REF_ and _REF_, the stability switch property and the effect from _MATH_ and _MATH_ on the period of the bifurcating periodic orbits are resembling, but the effect from the ratio _MATH_ on the period of the bifurcating periodic orbits is different.
When the scale of dispersal of the resident species is much larger than that of the invading species then the spread rate of the invading species is not linearly determined in homogeneous habitats _CITE_. 
The invading species may spread faster than the linearization predicts (see in particular Figure 1 by _CITE_). 
We numerically investigated the effect of heterogeneity on the spread rate of the invading species when the resident disperses at a much larger scale. 
The results are illustrated in Figure _REF_.
Lemma 2.4. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the fundamental solution of (2.1), which are given in (2.9) and (2.10), respectively. 
Let _MATH_, and let _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ be nonnegative integers. 
Then we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_, where _MATH_ in (2.26). 
Similarly, we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_ in (2.28) and _MATH_ in (2.29).
We should keep in mind that _MATH_ is n't necessarily good news. 
With as few as 100 nodes, _MATH_ is already 7, and as noted earlier, we may now be looking at delays of 350 ms or more in the best case-and perhaps much worse if the path is unlucky enough to hit a node or two running with a slow modem or on a slow computer. 
Chord therefore needs a mechanism to avoid performing lookups entirely. 
It does this by caching pointer information, in the hope that "cold" lookups will be infrequent events.
In the concrete situation of the parametric problem _REF_ we know from Theorem _REF_ that under the given assumptions we have _MATH_, and if additionally condition _REF_ holds it follows _MATH_. 
Together with the a priori estimates _REF_ we are almost in the situation of the previous summability theorems. 
Since we always have to fulfill the small-data-assumption _REF_, fulfilling the conditions _REF_ and _REF_ would imply _MATH_ to be bounded with respect to every component _MATH_, _MATH_, and thus (by Liouville's Theorem) to be constant. 
Eventually, this would yield the rather trivial result of affine dependence of the solution _MATH_ on the parameters.
Late-time acceleration and Phantom Divide Line Crossing with Non-minimal Coupling and Lorentz Invariance Violation
A nonlinear observer based impulsive control procedure is developed for the synchronization of nonlinear systems with multiple attractors. 
It is interesting to note that the synchronization remains valid even when the two systems remain in the vicinity of the two different attractors. 
In this respect we can mention that there are other nonlinear systems where one can have more than one such attractors. 
One important example is that of the system derived from chaotic Alfven wave in plasma [21].
If the group order _MATH_ is public and is a prime, we can instead use the obvious linear 2 out of _MATH_ secret sharing scheme where there are _MATH_ shares and the _MATH_'th share is _MATH_. 
If we again build a protocol by asking the prover to commit to the randomness by sending _MATH_ and then reveal the share of the verifier's choice, we get exactly Schnorr's protocol. 
From this point of view, the efficiency of this protocol can be explained from the fact that it is based on a 2 out of _MATH_ secret sharing scheme for a very large _MATH_.
If the origin _MATH_ is an exponentially stable equilibrium point of Eq. (_REF_) and if _MATH_, then there exists an _MATH_ such that _MATH_ _MATH_ and _MATH_ [0,_MATH_]. 
Moreover, The system (_REF_) has a unique, exponentially stable, _MATH_-periodic solution _MATH_ with the property _MATH_ for some _MATH_.
If _MATH_ is a pure state _MATHDISP_, then we obtain from Lemma _REF_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Now we have _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, Lemma _REF_ implies _MATHDISP_, that is, we have the following Lemma
The correct localization of face is not so sensitive for a skin locus based approach since the non-skin colored pixels can be filtered out. 
Large skin colored objects connected to the face are problematic and cues other than color are needed to solve this.
Let us parameterise _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_ Here _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are scalar functions of time, and this is the most general form we need for our assumed form of motion (restricted to the _MATH_ plane in 3D real space). 
Inserting _MATH_ into the Euler equation, and using the moments of inertia in (_REF_) we get the surprisingly simple results _MATHDISP_ 
The _MATH_ and _MATH_ derivatives tell us that _MATH_ is constant, suggesting a parametrisation of the form _MATHDISP_ for some function _MATH_ and scalar constant _MATH_ (called this since it is in fact the ordinary angular velocity of the body in 3D space).
There exists a constant _MATH_, such that, w.h.p., _MATHDISP_. 
The argument is closely related to the Markov chain comparison technique _CITE_. 
The proof is given in Appendix _REF_.
From the RMIB model we have an estimate of the TSI values during solar cycle 22. 
Figure 11 displays the estimated TSI of solar cycle 22 from the model fit over solar cycle 23 data, the RMIB composite is also represented. 
A 39-day moving average is applied to both curves, the model fits well with data after 1990. Before 1990 the model overestimates the data up to 0.4 W m_MATH_ in 1986. 
This is better observed in the Figure 11 where the residuals (difference between measurement and estimations) are shown. 
The _MATH_2_MATH_ interval covering solar cycle 22 and 23 is also plotted showing that 96% of the residuals are spread between _MATH_0.44 W m_MATH_. 
For comparison the _MATH_2_MATH_ interval limited to solar cycle 23 residuals is also plotted. 
The disagreement between the reconstructed data and the measurements before 1990 can be explained by the lack of ageing correction capabilities on ERBS which is the instrument that provided the measurements for this period. 
Therefore the new TSI composite time series is reproduced through the use of full disk indices from ground-based measurement (MPSI and _MATH_) and one space-based record of the Mg ii. 
Theses indices display radiative variability due to dark sunspots and faculae in the photosphere and bright plage and network in the chromosphere.
To investigate the basic features of arbitrary amplitude (AA) double layers (DLs) we have used the well known pseudo-potential approach _CITE_. 
Before this we have numerically analyzed the DLs height and thickness by reductive perturbation method using the sG equation [Eq. (_REF_)]. 
For clear understanding, we briefly demonstrate the stationary DLs solution of this sG equation. 
The stationary DLs solution of this sG equation is obtained by considering a moving frame (moving with speed _MATH_) _MATH_, and imposing all appropriate boundary conditions for DLs solutions, including _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
Thus, one can express the stationary DLs solution of this sG equation as _MATHDISP_, where the amplitude (_MATH_) and the width (_MATH_) of the DLs are _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
One can easily show by the numerical analysis of (_REF_) that the DLs exist only with positive potential _MATH_. 
Figure 5 shows graphically that the DLs amplitude (width) increases (decreases) with the increase of _MATH_.
For the purposes of this work, four active regions were analyzed as they evolved on the solar disk. 
NOAA 10727 emerged as a _MATH_ region on 24 January 2005 and experienced significant flux emergence on the 29th, before rotating off disk on 3 February 2005. 
NOAA 10763 rotated onto the disk on 11 May 2005 as a _MATH_ region. 
It subsequently formed a _MATH_ in its trailing portions and went into decay from 16 May 2005. 
The most active region in the sample was the rapidly emerging active regions, NOAA 10488. 
This region emerged on 26 October 2003 to become a _MATH_ region on the subsequent day. 
The final region in the sample was NOAA 10798, which emerged on 15 August 2005 and slowly grew in size and complexity over a ten day period.
We consider the sampled-data control input for the plant. 
It may be represented as delayed control as follows: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is a discrete control signal and the time-varying delay _MATH_ is piecewise linear with the time derivative equal to 1 except for the sampling instants fulfilling the following partial ordering _MATHDISP_ Sampling interval denoted by _MATH_ may vary but is bounded by an uppermost limit _MATH_. 
Thus, we can obtain _MATHDISP_
In the subsequent analysis a couple is said to face a welfare benefit "partnership bonus" (alt. 
"penalty") if they are entitled to more benefits as a couple than as singles. 
(See Sect. _REF_ for a formal definition.) 
In order to illustrate how partnership bonuses and penalties come about it is useful to construct some hypothetical families.
First, forward looking effective tax rates are known to be sensitive to the choice of expected rates of inflation and return. 
The benchmark results reported in the tables are based on a rate of inflation of 2.5 percent and a rate of return of 5 percent. 
In the sensitivity analysis we chose alternative parameter values of 5 percent for the rate of inflation and 3 percent for the the rate of return, respectively. 
However, while this affects the matrix of correlation coefficients as reported in Table _REF_ quite significantly, our conclusions from Table _REF_ do not change in qualitative terms: the impact of the country-level cost of capital on investment is positive (which is at odds with our expectations) and the one of firm-level cost of capital is negative as expected. 
The estimated parameters of sales and cost of capital are in a similar range as the ones in Table _REF_.
The role of toroidal magnetic field on the stability of accretion disks with alpha viscosity and other viscosities
To be more accurate with such an alysis and clear up some dubious points, it should be more convenient to verify two simple particular cases. 
In order to simplify the calculations, we set _MATH_ and we choose _MATH_ so that we can write, _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ so that _MATHDISP_. 
Otherwise, if we choose _MATH_, we shall obtain, _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ which gives _MATHDISP_. 
The latter negative value illustratively corroborates with the absurd possibility of the appearance of peak associated with the _MATH_ wave occurring before the arrival of the peak of the incident wave packet at _MATH_, a clear representation of discontinuity at _MATH_. 
As we have stated before, the phase derivative _MATH_ illustrated in Fig.(_REF_) does not present the adequate behavior for applying the SPM accurately. 
In spite of this, it is currently ignored in the literature.
The presence of unnecessarily small triangles has to do with the way Imesh inserts new vertices into the initial triangulation during its mesh generation step. 
In particular, these vertices are not guaranteed to be placed along a smooth (and imaginary) curve nor are they guaranteed to be distributed according to the curvature variation of this curve. 
So, the curves defining the boundary of the mesh partitions may be "jagged" or unnecessarily sampled in some regions. 
Since Ruppert's algorithm is sensitive to vertex proximity and local curvature variation, the mesh improvement step of Imesh tends to create small triangles along the more jagged or overly sampled regions of the curves to ensure mesh quality.
In the absence of any medium, the splitting kernels _MATH_ are the standard DGLAP kernels e.g. used for jets in _MATH_- annihilation. 
We introduce the medium in the splitting kernels by multiplying the infrared-divergent parts by a constant _MATH_ as done in _CITE_: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, and _MATH_ represents the splitting of a particle _MATH_ with momentum _MATH_ into a particle _MATH_ with momentum fraction _MATH_ and another particle _MATH_ with momentum fraction _MATH_. 
For _MATH_ we obviously recover the standard DGLAP kernels. 
While, on general grounds, one would expect that medium effects change not only the normalization but also the power of _MATH_ in the infrared-divergent parts of the splitting kernels, how to implement such modification in an analytic form is not known yet (a numerical implementation exists _CITE_). 
The simple ansatz _CITE_ that we implement captures some of the expected features of medium-induced gluon radiation, namely an increase of the number of collinear emissions, while allowing an analytical treatment. 
Concerning the behavior of the constant _MATH_, it is expected to grow with increasing medium length and transport coefficient, and decreasing parent-parton energy, but the quantitative relation has not been established yet.
Steiner's offset formula can be extended to the non-smooth and non-convex case _CITE_. 
In particular, various notions for curvatures of polygonal curves may be interpreted using Steiner's framework. 
Consider, e.g., _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes an inner vertex of a polygonal curve, and _MATH_ is the turning angle between the two line segments incident to _MATH_. 
These notions arise by applying _REF_ to the three different types of offsets depicted in Fig. _REF_. 
Among these, the first notion is the one considered by Steiner, the second corresponds to a finite element discretization using piecewise linear functions, and the third also arises in the theory of discrete integrable systems _CITE_.
Ramark 3 The result of Theorem 1.1 in [11] correspond to our results for the case _MATH_ and _MATH_ replace _MATH_. 
It is easy to see that _MATH_ is much weaker than _MATH_, hence the results of Theorems 3 and 4 extend the results of [11].
The appearance of the target is represented by an N-bin RGB color histogram computed from the region _MATH_, centered in _MATH_ at time _MATH_. 
If we define the reference target in region _MATH_ where the _MATH_ histogram is formulated as _MATH_, so the color density _MATH_ which estimates the color distribution at time _MATH_ is given by Eq. (_REF_). 
_MATHDISP_ Where, _MATH_ is the Kronecker delta function, _MATH_ is the location of any pixel in _MATH_, _MATH_ is a normalized constant and _MATH_ is a kernel profile, the most useful kernel is Epanechnikov kernel _CITE_.
As was mentioned before, the main drawback of _MATH_ based normal MT is their slow detail decay. 
As will be investigated in Section _REF_, to improve the decay rate of the detail coefficients one has to find _MATH_ with high order of polynomial exactness _MATH_ defined by (_REF_). 
We consider here a family of approximating cell-centered schemes _MATH_, _MATH_, appearing in _CITE_, which satisfy (_REF_) with _MATH_, are symmetric, and have minimal support. 
Here is the construction principle: Set up the formula _MATHDISP_ and determine the unique coefficients _MATH_ such that (_REF_) holds for all polynomials of degree _MATH_ for _MATH_ and shift parameter _MATH_. 
Then set _MATH_ for the indicated index range (and _MATH_ otherwise). 
By symmetry, set _MATH_ which automatically guarantees (_REF_) to hold at _MATH_). 
This defines the mask for _MATH_. 
Closed-form formulas can be found in _CITE_, by setting _MATH_, _MATH_, in formula (19) there, for even _MATH_, see also _CITE_. 
Obviously, _MATH_, this is the only scheme in the family with non-negative mask. 
For _MATH_ we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Straightforward computations show that also _MATH_, the minimal invariant neighborhood for _MATH_ is _MATH_, and the local subdivision maps for the derived subdivision operators _MATH_, _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_, correspondingly _MATHDISP_. 
For the joint spectral radii we obtain _MATH_. 
Hence, by Lemma _REF_ we conclude that the smoothness of _MATH_ is _MATH_.
This paper presents a general-purpose simulation approach integrating a set of technological developments and algorithmic methods in cellular automata (CA) domain. 
The approach provides a general-purpose computing on graphics processor units (GPGPU) implementation for computing and multi-rendering of any direct-neighbor three dimensional (3D) CA. 
The major contributions of this paper are; the CA processing and the visualization of large 3D matrices computed in real-time; the proposal of an original method to encode and transmit large CA functions to the graphics processor units in real time; and clarification of the notion of top-down and bottom-up approaches to CA that non-CA experts often confuse. 
Additionally a practical technique to simplify the finding of CA functions is implemented using a 3D symmetric configuration on an interactive user interface with simultaneous inside and surface visualizations. 
The interactive user interface allows for testing the system with different project ideas and serves as a test bed for performance evaluation. 
To illustrate the flexibility of the proposed method, visual outputs from diverse areas are demonstrated. 
Computational performance data are also provided to demonstrate the method's efficiency. 
Results indicate that when large matrices are processed, computations using GPU are two to three hundred times faster than the identical algorithms using CPU.
For each _MATH_ with _MATH_ we set _MATH_ and find _MATHDISP_. 
A direct computation reveals that the right hand side is nonnegative for _MATH_, and in view of _MATH_ we conclude that _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_ we also have _MATH_, and using _REF_ as well as the monotonicity of _MATH_, we readily verify by induction that _MATH_ for all _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
There exist positive constants _MATH_ and _MATH_ that are independent of _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
By Lemma _REF_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
The concavity of the logarithm implies _MATHDISP_, and hence _MATHDISP_. 
We therefore find _MATHDISP_, and this implies the desired result since _MATH_ is bounded, see Corollary _REF_. 
We now exploit the exponential decay of _MATH_ and derive tightness estimates. 
To this end we consider the moments _MATHDISP_, and notice that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
For any _MATH_ there exists a constant _MATH_ independent of _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
The high volume asymptotic regime is exactly as in Subsection _REF_, so that during [_MATH_, _MATH_, with prices and maximum leadtimes (_MATH_, _MATH_), the order arrival rates are _MATHDISP_, and the component production rates are _MATHDISP_ in the _MATH_th system for all _MATH_. 
The renewal processes _MATH_ and _MATH_ are defined in terms of the independent sequences of mean 1 non-negative random variables _MATH_ and _MATH_ having variances _MATH_ and _MATH_ that do not depend on _MATH_ so that _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_. 
It follows that _MATHDISP_, where we have also used the fact that _MATHDISP_.
Consider a polyhedral set _MATH_ defined in the state space as follows: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the interior and the boundary of _MATH_, respectively. 
The _MATH_th face of _MATH_, denoted by _MATH_, is described as follows: _MATHDISP_
The author declare that he has no competing interests.
In the proposed algorithm, the covariance matrix in the transform (_MATH_) and spatial domains (_MATH_) is related as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are forward and inverse-transform operations, respectively. _MATH_ is the diagonal matrix containing the expected noise power for each transform coefficient. 
The quantization noise within each quantization level is modeled as an independent uniform distribution _CITE_, thus the noise variance _MATH_ for transform index _MATH_ is expressed as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the width of the quantization interval.
Interestingly, even though the DCJ approach as formulated by Bergeron et al _CITE_ does not appear to have caps and nulls explicitly, nevertheless, their version of the distance agrees in value with that of the "basic" DCJ distance computed with the use of caps and nulls. 
The weighting scheme of Bergeron et al is also identical to that of the DCJ with caps and nulls.
The hot loops are thought to be heated by impulsive heating events, e.g. flares, micro-flares, nano-flares. 
The origin of these energisation mechanisms could be either waves or reconnection (_CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_). 
There have been a number of simulations investigating the evolution of coronal loops after heating events (see, e.g. _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_). 
Impulsive heating events only last for a relatively short duration and if the plasma reaches a hot enough temperature by the end of the heating, thermal conduction dominates the cooling of the plasma. 
From calculations by, e.g. _CITE_, the decrease in temperature due to thermal conduction takes an almost exponential form.
Let _MATH_ be a potential satisfying conditions (1) and (2) from Section _REF_. 
Any trajectory _MATH_ of Eq. (_REF_) completely contained in a compact set is heteroclinic, i.e., it approaches some critical points _MATH_ as _MATH_ and _MATH_ as _MATH_, and _MATH_.
Different from other methods for subdivision surface interpolation by which the interpolating surface has approximately same number of control vertices as that of interpolated mesh, the vertex number of mesh _MATH_ is about 4 times of the number of input vertices. 
So, our proposed subdivision surface interpolation method suffers limitation of data proliferation when the input mesh has large number of vertices. 
But practically, the initial mesh usually has a small size for surface interpolation. 
Then our proposed algorithm is promising for applications where data proliferation is not a major problem.
Observe that the spectral frequency _MATH_ is a complex number and its real and imaginary parts have a frequency dispersion as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
Although with the current phase parameters the dispersion in _MATH_ resembles the Debye response-a step in the real part and a loss peak in the imaginary part-it can have a more complicated dependence on the frequency. 
The final dispersion we obtain is the complex scaled permittivity _MATH_ as a function of angular frequency as shown in Fig. _REF_ again for different selected spectral parameters _MATH_ via changing _MATH_ in Eq. (_REF_). 
The dependence of complex permittivity on different spectral functions is clear. 
While the values of expected _MATH_ are changed on a large scale the relaxation in scale permittivity is in a short range, between 1 ms_MATH_ to 100 s_MATH_. 
Compared to the dispersion in complex permittivity and resistivity level the dispersion of the complex scaled permittivity is less complicated for simple composites-current systems have only one spectral parameter, _MATH_ is a delta function rather than a distribution.
Now we consider problem _MATH_. 
We first show that the problem is binary NP-hard and then we present a pseudo polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm. 
Finally, we show that the problem admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme.
Regarding notation, in NMPC it is important to distinguish between the open loop predictions and the NMPC closed loop. 
Here we have decided to denote the open loop predictions by _MATH_ or _MATH_ and the NMPC closed loop trajectories by either _MATH_ or-more often-by _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
There are, however, various other notations commonly found in the literature. 
For instance, the prediction at time instant _MATH_ is occasionally denoted as _MATH_ in order to emphasize the dependence on the time instant _MATH_. 
In our notation, the dependence on _MATH_ is implicitly expressed via the initial condition _MATH_ and the index _MATH_ in (OCP_MATH_) or (OCP_MATH_). 
Whenever necessary, the value of _MATH_ under consideration will be specified in the context. 
On the other hand, we decided to always explicitly indicate the dependence of open loop solutions on the control sequence _MATH_. 
This notation enables us to easily distinguish between open loop and closed loop solutions and also for simultaneously considering open loop solutions for different control sequences.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In Section _REF_, we describe the previous work on detail editing of surface. 
The core of our approach is described in Section _REF_. 
The experimental results and comparisons with exiting methods are discussed in Section _REF_. 
Finally this paper is concluded in Section _REF_.
For a given polygon _MATH_, our construction gives a set of points _MATH_ and a non-decomposable _MATH_-fold covering of _MATH_ by translates of _MATH_. 
It is not clear when we can extend this covering to a _MATH_-fold covering of the whole plane such that none of the new translates contain any point of _MATH_. 
This would be necessary to ensure that the covering remains non-decomposable.
The variation of TSI has important implications for our understanding of solar internal structure, global changes in the Earth's climate system, and solar-terrestrial relationships. 
The radiative output of the Sun establishes the Earth's radiation environment and affects the terrestrial temperature and atmosphere, and many investigations have thus considered whether and how the observed variations in solar irradiance influence the Earth's climate (Eddy, 1976; Reid, 1987; Haigh, 1996, 2001; Bond et al., 2001; Rind, 2002; Raychaudhuri, 2005; Coughlin and Tung, 2004; Kuroda and Kodera, 2005; Egorova et al., 2005; Dameris et al., 2006). 
Since the coupled system of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans reacts rather slowly to the varying solar signal, variations of solar irradiance on longer time scales, which have not been directly measured, are possibly of even greater importance for the global climate change ( e.g., Eddy, 1976; Krivova, Balmaceda, and Solanki, 2007). 
A large number of long-term reconstructions of TSI, both purely empirical and more physics-based, have thus been produced in the last two decades (for more details and references see the overviews by, e.g., Solanki and Krivova, 2004; Lockwood, 2005; Mekaoui and Dewitte, 2008; Domingo et al., 2009).
Example: 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_ then _MATH_. 
Therefore both _MATH_ and _MATH_ are logarithms of _MATH_, which are not even similar.
Using the terminology of the previous article, we can state the aim of this paper as follows: Classify, up to Darboux isomorphism, all 9-line affine Darboux arrangements of order four. 
Our first result is concerned with certain affine Darboux arrangements of order four with only seven lines. 
Here, as indeed throughout the whole paper we will assume that all Darboux arrangements contain the standard square.
We consider the dynamical evolution of an ultracold Fermi gas of atoms far from thermal equilibrium. 
The atoms are assumed to be, internally, in _MATH_ different hyperfine states. 
Hence, in the language of quantum field theory, we study the dynamics of nonrelativistic complex fermionic fields _MATH_ obeying canonical anticommutation relations _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes the anticommutator. 
The indices _MATH_ and _MATH_ count the _MATH_ hyperfine "spin" states. 
_MATH_-wave contact interactions between atoms in different hyperfine states are assumed, while Pauli's principle forbids _MATH_-wave collisions between fermions that are internally in the same state. 
_MATH_-wave and higher-order partial-wave contributions are neglected. 
Our formalism, though, can be readily extended to more complicated interaction potentials. 
In the contact potential approximation, the interactions in the channel characterized by the asymptotic hyperfine states _MATH_ and _MATH_ are described by the potential _MATH_ with a possibly time-dependent coupling strength _MATH_. 
In three spatial dimensions, the coupling strenght is related to the scattering length _MATH_ between states _MATH_ and _MATH_ by the relationship _MATH_. 
Hence, the interaction Hamiltonian reads _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ in _MATH_ spatial dimensions.
If _MATH_ then the left-translation _MATH_ and the right-translation _MATH_ are given _MATHDISP_.
Proposition 3.2 If all of the private goods are weak gross substitutes, then the weak Laffer effect exists. 
Moreover, the supreme tax revenue does not exceed the pre-tax labor income.
Note that we obtain two pieces of information from _MATH_, direction _MATH_ and angular momentum around _MATH_ with unit mass _MATH_, to measure both linear and angular motion in the vector field.
The present paper considers a PDE model of CAS therapy for prostate cancer with mutation and hypothetical mutation inhibitors. 
The mathematical model, tumor dynamics, and numerical simulations in this paper differs from those in Tao et al. [36] which dealt with a PDE model with competition. 
On the other hand, the proof of the global existence of solutions to the model in this paper is technically similar to that given in [36], so we will omit it. 
We also should mention that Guo et al. [15] only studied mathematical modeling and numerical simulation for a PDE model of IAS therapy for prostate cancer with mutation. 
As afore-mentioned, the present paper finds novel explicit formulae of tumor growth in an androgen-deprived environment, which is a great difference between this paper and the others [15, 36].
We have _MATH_ points in our limit cycle approximation and hence we need _MATH_ equations. 
Of these, _MATH_ equations are obtained from the phase condition and curvature-stretch conditions exactly similar to Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_). 
In higher dimensions, the first generalized curvature is obtained using the following formula _CITE_ _MATHDISP_ where primes denote derivatives with respect to the parametrizing index variable and _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
We can regard this two-photon process as the deep-inelastic scattering in the electron-positron collision where the target is a photon rather than a nucleon. 
In this point of view, we can define the photon structure functions as the analogues of the nucleon structure functions, and the photon structure functions are predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) and QCD. 
One of the difference between the nucleon structure functions and the photon structure functions is the target mass (_MATH_) dependence. 
The _MATH_ is not fixed for the virtual photon case, on the other hand, _MATH_ is fixed for the nucleon case. 
There are many good reviews for the theoretical as well as the experimental works for photon structure functions, for example, see _CITE_.
Remark 2. 
Apparently, the proposed fuzzy controllers have simple form. 
This means that such controllers are easily implemented in practice. 
To give a comparison with the conventional backstepping controllers, in Appendix B, we develop the controllers in Eqs. (_REF_) and (_REF_) via conventional backstepping. 
It can be seen clearly that the expression of these controller (_REF_) and (_REF_) are much more complicated than these adaptive fuzzy controllers (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
The number of terms in the expression of (_REF_) and (_REF_) are much larger. 
This drawback is called "explosion of terms" above _CITE_.
Recognition metric is used to evaluate the performance of our method, the quality of extracted features and their impact on identification. 
It is defined as the ratio of the number of the correctly recognized people to the number of all the people. 
The results for our database are shown in Table _REF_. 
We can see that 64.3% people are correctly recognized (5 errors out of 14 persons) by face profile and 85.7% people are correctly recognized by gait (2 errors out of 14 persons), respectively. 
For the fusion schemes, the best performance is achieved by the Sum rule at 100% accuracy. 
The Product rule and the indexing-verification scheme obtain the same recognition rate at 92.9%. 
When we use the indexing-verification scheme, we choose the first three matching results of the face profile classifier as candidates. 
Then, the gait classifier measures the similarity between the corresponding GEI of the testing people and the corresponding GEI of the training people in the candidate list. 
The unknown person is finally classified as the most similar class among the candidates.
Our conclusions concerning reification are further supported when we compare mean squared distances (_MATH_) from the complete simulator for the incomplete and reified simulators. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ represent respectively the _MATH_ for the incomplete and reified simulators, where _MATHDISP_. 
The _MATH_ is approximately twice as large as _MATH_; i.e., _MATH_.
We assume that the user has browsed through a low resolution preview simulation and specified a general region _MATH_ for matching. 
In implementations, we allow a user to define _MATH_, e.g. as the projected volume from a selected region in screen space, but the user can also simply set the whole domain to be of interest and let our system detect all the features for a complete match. 
We consider a position _MATH_ to be a candidate position to place a match point if any of following three inequality conditions is satisfied. _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are pre-defined minimum values close to 0. 
That is, we identify points with high density, large difference in density from the final, or high vorticity as candidates for placing samples.
In order to estimate the flux density penetrating into the superconducting coil, the prototype is modelled with 3D finite element analysis (FEA) software (Opera 3D). 
In Fig. _REF_ flux density distribution from the Z-axis (axis of rotation) is presented. 
The magnitude of the flux density as well as the perpendicular and parallel components of the flux density are presented. 
In Fig. _REF_ cut-through view of X-axis is presented. 
Again the parallel and perpendicular components are presented. 
Black arc and rectangles in the graphs represent the position of the superconducting wire. 
The outer area of the plots shows the position of the cryostat. 
There is 3 mm opening between the cryostat and claw poles. 
In Fig. _REF_ flux density distribution along the inner and outer circumference of the superconducting wire (i.e. through arcs of Fig. _REF_) are presented. 
These FEA simulations show that the perpendicular component of the flux density is less than 0.03 T and the parallel component is less than 0.35 T. 
The claw poles in the rotor structure behave as flux diverters and keep the flux penetrating into superconducting wire within reasonable range. 
One point that needs further investigation is the sinusoidal variation of the perpendicular flux component. 
Although, the magnitude is very small, it may induce eddy currents, which increase the thermal loading of the machine. 
In this case, a conductive shield may be used.
In the short range solution, the output of an optical detector, i.e., a photo diode (PD), can be used directly without additional amplification due to relatively low power requirements. 
Figure _REF_ shows the block diagram of such a system where the DUT is at the Tx side. 
The LD, which directly modulates an RF signal into an optical signal, is connected to the PD via optical fiber. 
The PD detects the optical signal and feeds the RF signal to the antenna.
For later reference we record that (4.1) can also be written as _MATHDISP_. 
From Theorem 3.3 and Lemma 4.1, we have _MATHDISP_. 
The above identity is equivalent to the following quadratic transform: _MATHDISP_. 
From (2.7) and (2.8), we can rewrite _MATHDISP_ as _MATHDISP_. 
The desired the identity is obtained by replacing _MATH_ with _MATH_.
It is convenient to notes here some effects of the fractional order _MATH_ on the behavior of dynamical systems
Let _MATH_ and let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the range and null space of _MATH_ respectively. 
According to Nashed _CITE_, any _MATH_ with _MATH_ closed has a Moore-Penrose inverse _MATH_ satisfying the equalities: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the adjoint operator of _MATH_.
At the first order we obviously get the following expression: _MATHDISP_ 
This expression requires some explanations. 
The action of _MATH_ on _MATH_ leads to an expression _MATH_ which depends both on _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The shift operation replaces _MATH_ by _MATH_ so that the integration is (trivially) performed on the variable _MATH_ only. 
To stress this point, let us first introduce a convenient notation. 
Recall that at the lowest order : _MATHDISP_. 
where the Berry phases can be replaced by their value at zeroth order (evaluated at _MATH_), that is : _MATHDISP_. 
since _MATH_, at that order.
Consider the quadratic form _MATH_. 
For simplicity, extend the summation over all _MATH_ by putting _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
By Proposition _REF_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_, and _MATH_ if and only if in _MATH_ there are no edges joining _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_ is always non-positive. 
It vanishes if and only if _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ lying in one connected component of _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ on the boundary component, the result follows.

Remark. 
Note that in the limit case _MATH_, we have _MATH_ and, therefore _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Thus, we deduce _MATH_.
_MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the lift force of the airfoil, _MATH_ is the drag force of the airfoil, _MATH_ is the dynamic pressure of the flow, _MATH_ is the density of the flow, _MATH_ is the velocity of the flow and _MATH_ is the surface area of the airfoil. 
Since _MATH_ and _MATH_ are constant for a given airfoil and flow conditions (_MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_) respectively, the above relation can be written as follows. _MATHDISP_ _MATH_ is estimated at various sample points (i.e. airfoil geometries) placed within the design space _MATH_ using the constructed surrogate models. 
The estimated values are compared with the actual values of _MATH_ which are calculated from separate CFD simulations. 
The comparison is shown in Fig. _REF_.
If _MATH_ is an random projection of _MATH_ invariant by rotation with trace 1, then _MATH_ has series expansion _MATHDISP_
Although the efficiency of damping is reduced by the cooling background plasma, the amplitude of longitudinal (acoustic) waves was found to decay rapidly due to the influence of thermal conduction. 
The rate of damping of the oscillations was found to depend on the initial temperature of the plasma and the amount of stratification. 
It was previously shown that thermal conduction leads to the damping of slow-mode oscillations. 
For example, the amplitude of slow modes in this study was found to undergo damping, whereas in _CITE_ the amplitude was found to experience a stronger damping. 
It should be noted that _CITE_ reported a strong damping of the slow mode due to the cooling of the background plasma by another dissipation mechanism, namely by radiation. 
Consequently, we conclude that the magneto-acoustic oscillations of the hot corona can experience a strong damping because of cooling by thermal conduction while radiation is dominant method for damping cool coronal oscillations.
Equations (_REF_)-(_REF_) provide the explicit expressions of the relative accelerations in a stringy charged black hole. 
Two comments are worth making about expression (_REF_). 
First there is no divergence in the radial direction at _MATH_. 
Secondly, the tidal field at the horizon in radial direction is larger for smaller black hole. 
This is simply because _MATHDISP_.
The characterization of the bounded Voronoi cells mentioned in Section 1 is as follows: _MATH_ is bounded if and only if _MATH_ (Voigt and Weis 2010). 
The proofs of the remaining results on Voronoi cells that we shall use can be found in Goberna et al (2010): if _MATH_, we have _MATH_, and _MATH_ whenever _MATH_; _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_ is an isolated point of _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ if and only if the closure of the characteristic cone of _MATH_ at _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, is a halfspace. 
In that case, _MATH_ is an accumulation point of _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ is closed, then _MATH_ is isolated in _MATH_; the converse statement holds when _MATH_ is closed. 
If _MATH_, then _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_. 
Actually, _MATH_ captures all the relevant information on _MATH_ (see Goberna and Lopez 1998, and references therein).
Fractional-order sliding mode control of the novel fractional-order hyperchaotic system
The conservation equations follow from eqs. (_REF_,_REF_,_REF_), _MATHDISP_, where the laboratory frame quantities are, _MATHDISP_. 
The local rest frame variables expressed through the laboratory frame quantities, the velocity and relativistic gamma are, _MATHDISP_, while the local rest frame effective pressure is, _MATHDISP_. 
Here the equilibrium pressure is given by the equation of state, _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the local speed of sound. 
The equations and quantities for a perfect fluid are obtained in the limit of vanishing dissipation corresponding to, _MATH_, while the form of conservation equations and the expressions relating the laboratory frame quantities to the rest frame quantities and the calculation of the velocity are formally the same as for perfect fluids.
Let us assume the action of our cosmological model in the radiation dominant era as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the action corresponding to the radiation. 
We take _MATH_ as the flat (_MATH_) Robertson-Walker metric _MATHDISP_, and _MATH_ as perfect fluid describing the radiation _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the scale factor, _MATH_ is the density and _MATH_ is the pressure of the radiation. 
It is easy to show that the dominant energy-momentum tensor in this era is traceless, _MATH_. 
Therefore, according to the arguments in the previous section, the conformal symmetry holds dominantly in this stage of universe evolution. 
The field equations (_REF_), (_REF_) are now explaining a cosmology of scalar-tensor type. 
Substituting _MATH_ and _MATH_ into these equations yields _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ means time derivative with respect to _MATH_. 
By combining Eqs. (_REF_) and (_REF_) we obtain the acceleration equation _MATHDISP_, and the conservation equation _MATHDISP_. 
If we put the power law behaviors _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ together with the equation of state _MATH_ (for radiation dominant era) into Eq. (_REF_) we obtain the following equations _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
It is easy to see that the universe may experience decelerating phase in radiation dominant era provided that _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, for some given suitable set of initial conditions _MATH_, one can obtain, through Eqs. (_REF_)-(_REF_), the values of _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ for which the above inequality is satisfied and we have a decelerating behavior for the radiation dominant era in the context of present scalar-tensor cosmology.
To facilitate repeated user interactions over prolonged periods, the HTTP/1.1 protocol defined key-value text strings to be issued by a server and handed to a client - so-called cookies. 
When the client's browser next communicates with the server, all cookies that have been handed to the client by that server are automatically submitted as a part of the HTTP request. 
The most common use of cookies is to provide a unique, hard-to-guess session identifier (session ID) to each client. 
When a user submits a request along with the appropriate session identifier, the server will be able to retrieve the state pertaining to the user, such as the user's name, whether she has been authenticated, her credit card information, and so forth.
The mean LOS magnetic field shows a steady increase from 05:10 to 06:00 UT with a strong variation as a sudden decrease, at the maximum of the flare (05:44 UT). 
The RMS of the magnetic field intensity shows a sudden decrease of about 9.6% of the background level, and a sudden recovery to a 3.6% increased background, as compared to the background level before the flare [similar changes have been observed by _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; see also the footnote 1 for more references.]. 
To obtain a general idea of the configuration of the coronal magnetic field lines in AR10656 we computed the potential field extrapolation by applying the code described in _CITE_ to the MDI line-of-sight magnetogram. 
According to this extrapolation (Figure _REF_, top frame), the field lines whose footpoints were planted in the general region of the acoustic emission were relatively low and compact, suggesting that the magnetic loops, into which particle acceleration occured during the reconnection, were relatively short. 
The second panel in Figure 9 shows the appearance after the flare maximum of more magnetic field lines connecting the positive and negative polarities. 
A small difference in the line-of-sight magnetic field configuration in the region of the acoustic emission described by the inclined rectangle is also noticeable.
It is reasonable for biologically realistic models of genome rearrangements to include more than one kind of operation, however in trying to consider generalized reversals and transpositions together in the menu of operations, researchers were somewhat baffled how to weight transpositions relative to reversals and translocations, which occur more frequently. 
In an intriguing paper, Blanchette et al (1996) _CITE_ allowed the weight of transpositions to vary relative to a weight of 1 for inversions in order to deduce the best weight. 
The authors noted there was a trade-off between inversions and transpositions, although some transpositions do not seem to be replaceable by inversions even with high values of the weighting function for transpositions. 
Using a greedy algorithm for genome rearrangements, they concluded that a weight just over 2 for transpositions and inverted transpositions was best able to optimize the rearrangement distance score for bacterial and mitochondrial genomes.
As was noted above, each particle in a SH is coated by an a polymeric shell (adlayer). 
The typical adlayer depth is _MATH_ for the sphere radius of _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ is the adlayer depth when the particles are far apart; the equilibrium adlayer depth in a bisphere is denoted by _MATH_ and is different from _MATH_ due to the action of various radial forces. 
At such distances, the Van-der-Vaals attraction is still sufficiently strong for the particles to form rigid aggregates. 
The Van-der-Waals attraction is balanced by the elasticity force. 
Computation of this force is subject of the so-called Hertz deformation problem _CITE_ (see Fig. _REF_ for an illustration). 
Note that, unlike in the classic Hertz problem, in our case the spheres contain metal kernels. 
However, for small deformations, the presence of the kernels can be ignored.
Cryptographic protocols require problems that are easy for legitimate users but hard for attackers. 
The hardness of a problem may be either computational (when attackers are assumed computationally bounded) or information-theoretic (when attackers are computationally unbounded). 
Ideally, a problem should be reliably easy for legitimate users (i.e., the chance of failure for legitimate users should be negligible), but reliably hard for attackers (i.e., the chance of the attacker's success is negligible). 
In reality, one may have a problem which is only somewhat easier for legitimate users than for attackers, i.e., the gap between the ability of legitimate users to solve the problem and that of attackers is relatively small. 
It is thus important to have a method for increasing this gap, thereby improving the security of cryptographic protocols based on such problems.
(3) The case of complex conjugate solutions _MATH_. 
This case arises if the discriminant _MATH_ is negative. 
The most elegant way to deal with this case is to switch to complex variables and to perform the computations in the complex vector space _MATH_. 
We first determine complex vectors _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ and then decompose _MATH_ into real and imaginary part with vectors _MATH_, _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_, it follows that _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_ forms a basis of _MATH_. 
Thus _MATH_ is a basis of _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_, consequently _MATHDISP_. 
Again we set _MATHDISP_ from which we deduce _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Thus _MATH_ is similar to a matrix of type III.
We deal with a planar underactuated biped model with semicircular feet and a torso as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
We add a 1-link torso as the upper body to the biped incorporating a BHM. 
Its mass and inertia moment are _MATH_ [kg] and _MATH_ [kg_MATH_m_MATH_]. 
The joint torques between the torso and stance-leg, _MATH_, and swing-leg, _MATH_, are known. 
The central point of the foot circle is positioned on the leg link, and the foot radius is _MATH_ [m]. 
Let _MATH_ be the generalized coordinate vector; the dynamic equation of the biped model then becomes _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes the constraint force vector caused by the BHM. 
The details of _MATH_ and _MATH_ are as follows. _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
The control input vector _MATH_ is also defined as _MATHDISP_.
Section _REF_ contains statements and proofs of our main results, the proof of best _MATH_-term approximation rates of the parametric solutions _MATH_ of _REF_. 
Three particular types of approximation are considered: tensorized Taylor-, Chebyshev and Legendre expansions of _MATH_ with respect to the coordinate vector _MATH_. 
The proof uses arguments from _CITE_, and is given in Sections _REF_-_REF_. 
We emphasize, however, that the present arguments combine results from _CITE_ and allow to sharpen also some of the results obtained in these references. 
In Section _REF_, finally, we consider the restricted _MATH_-term approximations where the sparsity models _MATH_ are restricted to the class of monotone index sets (as in _CITE_, see also Definition _REF_).
In appendix _REF_, we give a list (A1)-(A5) of desirable properties of corresponding measures of association. 
Association measures _MATH_ satisfying these requirements may also be called measures of dependence. 
Also several examples of such measures are briefly reviewed in appendix _REF_.
_MATH_: a transformed version of _MATH_: _MATH_ is transformed so that its geometry as a group of pixels is aligned with that of _MATH_. 
With this transformation, the texture discrepancy between _MATH_ and _MATH_ can be computed by a simple pixel-based similarity evaluation. 
We refer to this image as a transformed face-image-segment.
Next assume _MATH_. 
Once again, let _MATH_ be Biggs' graph of degree _MATH_ and girth at least _MATH_ greater than _MATH_. 
As before, take _MATH_ to be an extension of _MATH_ by a product of length _MATH_ and its inverse: _MATHDISP_ (the product is obtained by repeatedly multiplying the elements of _MATH_ in the order _MATH_ until reaching the desired length _MATH_; note that _MATH_ is assumed to be smaller than _MATH_). 
The proof of the fact that _MATH_ is a Cayley graph of degree _MATH_ and girth _MATH_ follows now along the same lines as the first half of the proof.
Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) is one of the most frequently studied areas in the sky. 
In a comprehensive study _CITE_ the astronomers have collected astrometric, photometric, and morphological data on _MATH_ astrophysical object (for example, galaxies, stars, and quasars). 
The measurements of the spectro-photometric data have been performed in _MATH_ wavelength bands spanning the range between _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The whole COMBO-17 ( Classifying Objects by Medium-Band Observations-A spectrophotometric _MATH_-filter survey ) data set is accessible at _CITE_.
The adaptation of Proposition _REF_, Theorem _REF_ and Corollary _REF_ requires a little more care because of the direction of the monotonicity of the transformations involved, as is obvious from Proposition _REF_. 
We will include here the statements without proof, as these are obvious taking into account the previous comment. 
Let _MATH_ be independent pairs of random variables such that, for each _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are NQD. 
Let _MATH_ be such that, for each _MATH_, when considered as functions of _MATH_-coordinate alone one is nondecreasing and the other is nonincreasing and define _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_.
The paper is organized as follows. 
First, we briefly recapitulate and formulate the equations of dissipative fluid dynamics and the numerical method which will be used to solve the respective equations. 
Afterwards we present and discuss the results in several cases. 
To our knowledge major parts of this work including the specific comparisons between the 1st-order and 2nd-order theories is presented and discussed in detail for the first time.
Accordingly, in order to prevent unauthorized leakage or tampering of information, strong cryptographic techniques have to be used to cipher all the confidential and critical data stored on distributed file systems infrastructures and to secure end-to-end all communications involved in their access/retrieval. 
Clearly, the use of encryption implies the use of keys and their distribution to authorized parties, to enable secure file sharing among multiple trusted users within a fully distributed environment.
For this choice of inputs, there is also the possibility of satisfying the electroweak boundary conditions without the Higgs bi-linear term in the Kahler potential. 
The black solid line is where _MATH_ and hence the generalized GM term is not needed. 
These points with _MATH_ are suggestive of a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. 
In a theory symmetric under the PQ symmetry, both _MATH_ and _MATH_ are vanishing. 
If the PQ symmetry is broken by the vev of some field _MATH_ with vev of order _MATH_ GeV, the axion could be the dark matter of the universe. 
This field can also, through Planck suppressed operators _MATHDISP_, explain the origin of a _MATH_ parameter of order _MATH_ TeV _CITE_.
Surprisingly, there seems to be a non-random relationship between the underwriter market share and the characteristics of sponsors and servicers involved in the transaction. 
The average sponsor rating in the group of issues underwritten by top underwriters is more than one rating class below the average sponsor rating in the group of less reputable underwriters (5.74 versus 4.50). 
In addition, despite the lack of any difference in the average size (total assets) of sponsors, top underwriters tend to underwrite issues of sponsors with worse profitability, i.e., with lower ROAA and higher CIR. 
Additionally, the average servicer rating is lower (6.26 versus 5.08) in the top underwriter group, and servicers tend to be smaller (lower total asset volume). 
We will park this finding for now and revisit it in the later section together with the results from the regression analysis.

In early December 2005 he received the Clay Prize at a ceremony at Oxford University. 
Bhargava was appointed Full Professor at Princeton University at the age of 28 and is the youngest to hold that high rank in that prestigious institution.
Further statistical analysis of the dependencies between the various intermediate parameters may be necessary to obtain a complete statistical description. 
In particular, as regards the angular radiation patterns, the statistics of the phase difference between the spherical modes was found to be nonuniform and again Gaussian distributed. 
As a result of this analysis, it appears that generating an antenna statistical set from a convened multivariate distribution on these intermediate parameters appears both feasible and efficient. 
However further work is still needed to confirm the validity of the method and extend it to a variety of antennas, particularly in the directional case.
We consider again the case that one species is competitively superior to the other in the non-hostile patches and ask the question of how landscape heterogeneity combined with dispersal can lead to species coexistence. 
The crucial difference to the previous case is that the inferior competitor is inferior at every spatial location and has no patch on which it can out-compete its opponent. 
Two competing species then cannot coexist anymore via spatial separation. 
Yet, we will demonstrate that coexistence is still possible and depends on their relative dispersal scales. 
Lemma _REF_ and Figure _REF_ give approximate coexistence conditions that show that the inferior invader requires shorter dispersal than the superior resident in order to persist. 
To maximize its spatial rate of spread, an inferior invader has to disperse at some intermediate distance. 
Too short or too large dispersal distances will lead to slower invasions if at all (Figure _REF_).
The mass terms for KK modes can be written down in a matrix form by using Dirac fermion _MATHDISP_, which is diagonalized by the change of basis _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_. 
Rewriting (_REF_) in terms of mass eigenstates _MATH_ and _MATH_, we find that top KK mass eigenvalue is _MATH_ and top Yukawa coupling is _MATH_, respectively _CITE_. 
Making use of this information, the KK mode contributions in our model are found to be _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ where "UED_MATH_" denotes our 6D UED model on _MATH_ _CITE_ (5D UED model on _MATH_ _CITE_, which will be discussed later), respectively. 
A factor "2" is multiplied in the second line, since the degrees of freedom of 6D fermion are doubled compared with the SM case. 
In the second and the third equalities, the mode sum is decomposed into even or odd number term of _MATH_ since the degeneracy _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_ is different, e.g. _MATH_ for _MATH_: even (odd) _CITE_. 
The limit _MATH_ have been taken in the last line to simplify the results. 
As expected from the dimensional analysis, the mode sum is logarithmically divergent. 
Also, note that the KK mode contribution is constructive against the top quark contribution in the SM.
Proof. 
Although some statements of Theorem _REF_ such as, e.g., (_REF_), are covered by Theorem _REF_, we will give a self-contained proof. 
In particular, we obtain the global well-definedness of this normal MT, and the limit case _MATH_ if _MATH_ in (_REF_), not covered by Theorem _REF_. 
We split the proof into several steps. 
Step 1. 
We first argue that the normal MT with _MATH_ is always well-defined. 
Let _MATH_ be given by its arc-length parametrization _MATH_. 
Fix an arbitrary level _MATH_ and an arbitrary position _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is continuous and the points _MATH_ and _MATH_ belong to different hyper-planes with respect to the parallel lines _MATH_, _MATH_, these two lines will intersect at least once the open arc _MATH_ connecting _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Now, if we choose _MATH_, resp. _MATH_ then automatically _MATH_. 
This guarantees the well-posedness.
Three approaches are considered for the transformation of the absolute nodal velocities. 
From numerical examples it can be observed that the first approach, a transformation with a node-attached reference frame, suffers from different dynamical responses if the direction of the elements in the model are reversed. 
The second approach, a transformation with an average orientation reference frame, is not susceptible to reversing the direction of the elements. 
In the third considered approach, the angular velocities are expressed in the reference frames attached to the superelement nodes, while the translational velocities are expressed in the average orientation reference frame. 
For the considered numerical examples, this approach yields the smallest errors and appears to be the most robust implementation for the transformation of the velocities.
Simulation is carried out for three cases under the initial condition of _MATH_ in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. 
In the first case, we tested the chaotic PMSM drive system with _MATH_, which are shown in Figs. 2-4. 
It is clearly seen that chaos occurs without control input signals. 
For another two cases, the proposed adaptive fuzzy approach is used to control the chaotic PMSM system for different _MATH_, _MATH_ and reference signals. 
For the second case, _MATH_, _MATH_ and the given reference signal is _MATH_; and for the third case _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The control parameters are chosen as follows: _MATHDISP_.
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be fixed real constants. 
We define _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
Then _MATHDISP_ 
We assume _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ are functions in _MATH_ to be determined. 
Moreover, (8.3.6) becomes _MATHDISP_ which is implied by _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
The observed manifestation of this precession behaviour in 2D real space, is that there is an apparent _MATH_-directed component of force on the spinning object, when it is projected in the _MATH_-direction. 
We interpret this as a non-relativistic analogue of the force on spinning objects in general relativity, first described by Papapetrou _CITE_. 
Using our analytic approximation, it is possible to work out the magnitude of this force in our approach, and indeed to generalise it to a general velocity and angular momentum. 
We find, in conventional 3D vector algebra notation, _MATHDISP_ Here _MATH_ is the object velocity, and _MATH_ is its 3D angular momentum. 
A clear exposition of the relativistic form of coupling expected can be found in _CITE_, where it is shown that the expected contribution to the 'geodesic equation' is _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the 4D velocity of the object, _MATH_ is its 'spin bivector', and _MATH_ is the Riemann tensor of the space (which in a geometric algebra formulation, maps bivectors to bivectors, see Chapter _REF_).
Since this measure has to take a minimum over all disentangled states, it is difficult to compute it, in particular, for infinite dimensional Hilbert space.
One only needs to verify that conditionally to _MATH_, the law of _MATH_ is the uniform law on pairs of spaces containing _MATH_ and _MATH_ (in particular, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are independent conditionally to their dimension). 
By construction, _MATH_ is independent of _MATH_ conditionally to _MATH_, and uniformly distributed. 
Consider then _MATH_, conditioned by its dimension _MATH_. 
We construct _MATH_ in the same way as in Lemma _REF_: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ uniformly chosen among completions of _MATH_ into a free family of length _MATH_. 
Denote _MATH_ the images of the random vectors _MATH_ by the quotient map _MATH_, and similarly with _MATH_.
From the above proof, the condition that _MATH_ is relatively compact can be relaxed to _MATH_ is relatively compact for every totally ordered subset. 
Additionally, by using the same method, the above theorem can be generalized to the following one: 
Suppose _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ is an increasing operator satisfying (_REF_). 
If _MATH_, where _MATH_(_MATH_ is an ordered Banach space) and _MATH_ is increasing operator and _MATH_ is relatively compact for every totally ordered subset (_MATH_), then the conclusion of theorem _REF_ holds. 
(See Sun-Zhao _CITE_) An operator _MATH_ is said to be convex if for _MATH_, _MATH_ with _MATH_ and every _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_.
Several authors have reported the dependence of differential rotation on sunspot activity. 
_CITE_ showed that the solar rotation tends to be less differential to the end of an activity cycle with the Greenwich sunspot data (1940 - 1968). 
_CITE_ similarly showed that the rotation is more differential at the solar minimum and is less differential at the solar maximum from Meudon data (1977 - 1984). 
With much longer Greenwich data (1874 - 1976), _CITE_ confirmed the results of previous authors. 
Furthermore, _CITE_ obtained the same result with their 17 years magnetogram data. 
On the contrary, _CITE_ argued that the solar rotation is less differential at the activity minimum and more differential at the activity maximum from their sunspot observations at Kanzelhohe. 
On the other hand, we have more than three cycles of the Mt. 
Wilson Doppler and helioseismic observations of the 'torsional oscillation', which is a sunspot-cycle modulation of the differential rotation with a period of 11 years, drifting from the poles to the equator in 22 years (_CITE_; _CITE_). 
So we do not yet have an observationally conclusive result on the relation between sunspot activity and the differential rotation.
The tasks of fingertip localization are to find the 3D locations of the fingertips and assign a label _MATH_ to each of them. 
As in _CITE_, we first build a graph _MATH_ using the point cloud _MATH_. 
_MATH_ consists of all points within _MATH_. 
For each pair of vertices _MATH_, there is an edge between _MATH_ and _MATH_ if and only if they are in the 8-neighbohood of each other and their 3D distance _MATH_ is within threshold _MATH_. 
Each edge is assigned a weight _MATH_, where _MATH_ if _MATH_ and _MATH_ are within the same hand part, and _MATH_ otherwise. 
While the resulting graph may not be connected, we search for a set of connected components in _MATH_ using the union-find algorithm. 
The connected component that contains the palm center is identified and all other connected components are connected to it by finding their nearest vertices and adding an edge with weights equal to the 3D Euclidean distance. 
In this way all vertices in _MATH_ are connected.
In a typical thermo-luminescence, the recombination emission of trapped ions or of neutral free radicals is detected by excitation with ionizing radiation. 
When polymers are heated in an air or oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures, a light emission caused by oxidation is known as the oxy-luminescence _CITE_. 
The OL is attributable to the electronic transitions and starts to grow at the melting or glass transition temperatures till the sample is de-polymerized or the oxidation sites completely disappears. 
An onset of OL starts at 200_MATH_C and peaks at 316_MATH_C (Fig. _REF_(a)). 
At this temperature sample loses its mass fast as shown by thermo-gravimetry data (Fig. _REF_(b)) and reveals decomposition and vaporization but not carbonization. 
Indeed, PMMA is usually not carbonized even under intense CO_MATH_ 10-_MATH_m-wavelength laser processing and cutting, which makes it a material of choice for fabrication of micro-fluidic chips.
Decametric-hectometric radio emission as a signature of CME interaction was discussed in some detail in two event studies _CITE_. 
In both events the radio emission had a limited bandwidth, and was referred to as a continuum. 
In the present case this emission is likely a set of type III bursts and was therefore labelled type III_MATH_. 
The starting frequency and the timing of these bursts are consistent with the idea that the electrons are accelerated while the faster following CME catches up with the slower preceding one.
In order to obtain an indication of the potential impact of welfare policy on partnership rates, consider the WFTC reform. 
We can combine the impacts on the group-specific average net bonuses shown in Fig. _REF_ with the group-specific estimated response rates presented in Table _REF_. 
For low educated women the WFTC reform increased the average net Tax Credit bonus by about ¬£15 per week. 
This would imply an increased partnership rate in this group of little over one percentage point. 
The corresponding figure for the medium educated women would be around half a percentage point, while the response among high educated women would be negligible. 
Hence, the model suggests that if the WFTC program had been allowed to continue it could potentially have increased the aggregate partnership rate by anything up to as much as 0.7 percentage points. 
Of course, the WFTC version of the Tax Credits was abandoned in favor of WTC/CTC which reversed the temporary improvement of partnership incentives.
We have presented an algorithm for continuation of limit cycles occuring in parameterized systems of autonomous ODEs. 
The algorithm approximates the limit cycle using a number of points in phase space, and interpolates between them using an artificial index-based variable and cubic splines. 
The approach seems useful, in particular, close to homoclinic points. 
Comparisons with the standard algorithm used by MATCONT have been favorable close to such saddle homoclinic points.
Figure _REF_ demonstrates ellipsoid fitting where _MATH_ scattered points are located in three-dimensional space, and are shown with dots. 
The solid shape corresponds to maximum likelihood fit (geometric distance minimization) while wire-frames correspond to direct ellipsoid fit _CITE_ and ellipsoid fit using the proposed method. 
The 2D figures are projections of the 3D figure to the _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ axes, where the coordinate system is centered at the ellipsoid. 
The ellipsoid has semi-axes radii of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It is clearly shown how the proposed method (dash-dot line, which in most cases blends with the continuous line) outperforms direct ellipsoid fit (dashed line) and how close it is to maximum likelihood fit (continuous line) but is computed without iterations.
If, on the other hand, _MATH_ divides exactly one of the _MATH_'s, we get terms of the form _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_.
In the previous section, we showed that the Betti diagram of the Stanley-Reisner ideal implies the existence of toric ideal generators of certain degrees. 
Here we give a way to construct those binomials explicitly. 
In general, this is a nontrivial task for any reasonably complicated model. 
We focus on binary hierarchical models, that is, for the case when all random variables have two states. 
The general result follows similarly.
Wireless Ethernet usually employs infrared or radio frequency communication and can be applied for both peer-to-peer and infrastructure communication. 
Although wireless Ethernet offers a great deal of flexibility, its effectiveness is significantly reduced by its incapability of transferring messages over a long distance (about 100-200 m). 
In addition, wireless Ethernet is more prone to message collision as some nodes may not be able to recognize another transmission due to physical obstruction (unlike the case of wire Ethernet). 
This problem is usually solved by virtual checking, whereby a transmitting node sends a request to all nodes and waits for permission prior to sending a message. 
This, however, is still an ongoing research area.
According to the defined pixel adjacency, at a current pixel we have to test all the adjacent pixels in a defined order such that we keep to our strategy (i.e. object region either always on the right, or always on the left).
In order to establish criteria for the onset of eruptive instability in prominences, Vrsnak (1990c) proposed a model of a uniformly twisted, semi-toroidal prominence anchored at both ends in the photosphere. 
The model provides the critical value of the twist as a function of the semi-torus aspect ratio. 
A prominence with twist smaller than critical is bound to be stable. 
Measurements performed by Vrsnak, Ruzdjak, and Rompolt (1991) and Romano, Contarino, and Zuccarello (2003), seemingly supported the model results by Vrsnak (1990c).
Scalings of _MATH_ Spectral Properties with _MATH_ for Power-law Electron Injection
We fix _MATH_ and denote by _MATH_ the subset on the right-hand side in the first formula. 
We pick _MATH_. 
Then, for _MATH_ we have that _MATH_ and, so, _MATH_. 
Given _MATH_, we denote _MATH_ so that _MATH_. 
Then, since _MATH_ we obtain that _MATH_, showing that _MATH_. 
Conversely, we pick _MATH_ and _MATH_ so that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Thus, since _MATH_ we deduce that _MATH_ and, so, by the arbitrariness of _MATH_ it follows that _MATH_.
The plan of this work is organized as follows. 
Section 2 contains some necessary notations, definitions and lemmas that will be used in the sequel. 
In Section 3, we establish a theorem on existence of solutions for the coupled system (_REF_) based on the coincidence degree theory due to Mawhin _CITE_.
Regarding the cost function _MATH_, the setting described in Sections _REF_ and _REF_ is easily extended to the case in which a set instead of a single equilibrium or a time variant family of sets instead of a single reference shall be stabilized. 
Indeed, if we are given a family of sets _MATH_ such that for each _MATH_ there is a control _MATH_ with _MATH_, then we can modify _REF_ to _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, we can modify _REF_ in the time invariant case.
For the further development of the idea concerning the relation between integral and geometrical inequalities see Miranda _CITE_, Burago and Maz'ya _CITE_ (the integrability of traces on _MATH_ of functions in _MATH_, etc.; these results are presented in Chapter _REF_), Federer _CITE_ (embedding theorems for currents), Klimov _CITE_-_CITE_, _CITE_ (embedding theorems involving Birnbaum-Orlicz and rearrangement invariant spaces), Michael and Simon _CITE_, Hoffman and Spruck _CITE_, Aubin _CITE_ (the Sobolev-Gagliardo inequalities for functions on manifolds), Otsuki _CITE_, Martin and M. Milman _CITE_ (embedding theorems involving rearrangement invariant spaces). 
Lemma _REF_/2 was proved by Deny and J.L. Lions _CITE_.
Figure _REF_ shows the distance - time plot for the wave propagation, both in the 171 √Öand 195 √Öbandpasses. 
The distances are measured from the point marked by a symbol "0" in Figure _REF_ (but this point is not taken into account for speed calculations below). 
The positions of the wave front in two bandpasses are very close in nearly simultaneous images (separated by 30 seconds). 
The only exception may be our last measurement. 
The wave front in the 171 √Öbandpass can be last detected at 18:18:30 UT, whereas it is still well visible in the 195 √Öbandpass at 18:20:30 UT. 
Around that time the front became very weak in the 171 √Öbandpass, so its position is rather uncertain. 
These last measurements of the wave front position around 18:18 UT - 18:20 UT are not significant for the overall wave propagation.
The good news: If we start from the minimal standard model, which contains just a single Higgs doublet field - and thus, after electroweak symmetry breaking, just a single neutral scalar - the Higgs portal might be quite challenging to exploit. 
Given a richer Higgs sector, including charged fields (as in low-energy SUSY), or more if "Higgs particles" appear as decay products of particles that are more identifiable, it could be much easier. 
In any case, a new world would be open to exploration.
Oliveira et al. _CITE_ analyzes the set of semantic and non-semantic (e.g., image/audio quality) features that contribute to human perception of similar videos. 
In contrast, here we take a different approach since we aim at understanding what is the collective perception of duplicates in a video sharing service. 
In other words,Despite having similar content, duplicated videos may exhibit different metadata (e.g., tags and categories) and may have different popularity indicators (e.g., number of views and ratings). 
The same content can be viewed in completely different ways by different users. 
Quantifying the different perceptions of the social community is important for two reasons. 
The first one refers to the need of understanding how users associate metadata to videos on video sharing services, such as YouTube. 
Such understanding is crucial for video information retrieval mechanisms since the current systems rely mostly on tags and other metadata associated by users. 
The second reason is associated with understanding possible reasons that influence on the popularity of videos, which is important to the association of advertisements to videos and to performance issues related to the use of caches and CDNs. 
Moreover, it is also important to increase the understanding of factors that contribute to the creation of duplicated videos.
The study of spread rates in heterogeneous environments for single species models in continuous time began with the work by _CITE_ and has since been extended to a variety of different situations, including two-dimensional domains _CITE_, competing species _CITE_, asymmetric dispersal _CITE_, discrete-time equations _CITE_, and more rigorous analytical results _CITE_. 
Most of these modeling approaches represent landscape heterogeneity as two types of patches that are periodically alternating in space. 
While this assumption clearly falls short of continuous natural variation in a landscape, it captures the most basic concepts of landscape ecology where landscapes are divided into 'patches' that are then classified as either 'habitat' or 'matrix'. 
In addition, the simplification to piecewise constant coefficient functions allows for some analytical results.
The next lemma is a version of Lemma 3.1 in Watanabe (1967) and the proof is similar, so we omit the proof here.
For a more general skin model, one should use the knowledge of illumination changes, calibration and camera settings like in the skin locus-based approach _CITE_. 
The drawback of this model is that it is not so specific as canonical models - more color tones are included. 
Thus, more non-skin objects will be considered skin candidates. 
Since color itself is rarely enough to determine whether the target is skin or not, the face candidates are in case subjected for further processing.
Applying the (generalized) polar transformation _MATHDISP_, one can conclude from _REF_ that _MATHDISP_. 
Now standard arguments from the theory of regular variation show that the limiting distribution _MATH_ must be a product measure with first factor equal to the standard Pareto distribution and the second factor being some distribution _MATH_ on the upper right quadrant _MATH_ of the unit "circle" with respect to the norm _MATH_. 
Unlike in the univariate setting, all possible limit distributions do not form a parametric family, because the so-called spectral probability measure _MATH_ can be any distribution on _MATH_ satisfying the condition _MATHDISP_, that follows from the fact that all marginal cdf's are standard Pareto. 
In the literature, instead of _REF_ often the equivalent assumption _MATHDISP_ is considered, where _MATH_ is some Radon measure on _MATH_ (see e.g. Resnick (2007), Section 6.1). 
Similarly as before, one can conclude that the measure _MATH_ induced by the polar transformation is the product of the measure with Lebesgue density _MATH_ on _MATH_ and a finite measure _MATH_ on _MATH_, the so-called spectral measure. 
The latter is related to the spectral probability measure via _MATHDISP_.
In this work, we have explored high performance sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) kernels in different formats on current many-core platforms and used them to construct effective iterative linear solvers with several preconditioner options. 
If a triangular solve cannot be accelerated using level scheduling on GPUs, this computation will be accomplished by CPUs. 
By this hybrid CPU/GPU computations, IC preconditioned CG method and ILU preconditioned GMRES method are adapted to a GPU environment and achieve performance gains compared to its CPU counterpart. 
In order to achieve better GPU-acceleration, a few preconditioners with enhanced parallelism were considered. 
Among these, the block Jacobi preconditioner is the simplest but it is usually not efficient since it requires many iterations to converge. 
For matrices which can be colored with a small number of colors, multi-color SSOR/ILU(0) preconditioners could provide a better performance since their preconditioning operations can be executed with high parallelism and they can yield comparable convergence rates to the standard ILU preconditioners. 
For symmetric linear systems, the Least-Squares polynomial preconditioner can be much more efficient for the PCG method since its preconditioning operation relies on the SpMV kernel.
We solve the equation (17) numerically for arbitrary wave-length. 
The stability properties of two inertial acoustic modes, thermal, and viscose modes can be obtained by analyzing of five kinds of solutions of the dispersion relation. 
The _MATH_ is a trivial solution. 
The real parts of these solutions correspond to the growth rates of the perturbation modes and the imaginary parts correspond to their propagative properties. 
We will solve the dispersion relation for optically thin and optically thick disk and consider the effect of magnetic field and magnetic pressure on the stability of disks.
'_MATH_ UNION _MATH_' is equivalent to: _MATH_ if _MATH_ is empty, to _MATH_ if _MATH_ is empty, to '_MATH_ REDUCE _MATH_ TO _MATH_' otherwise;
In the domain of AIS, the seminal work of _CITE_ using mathematical models inspired a variety of immune-network algorithms, for example _CITE_. 
Models of self-assertion in idiotypic networks by _CITE_ are further developed by _CITE_ who suggest that the emergent phenomena observed in separation of the shape-space can be exploited in machine-learning algorithms. 
Agent-based models are utilised by _CITE_ to illustrate the properties that emerge from dendritic cell trafficking. 
The authors discuss the necessity of altering the agent-based model, originally based on biological principles, to adapt it to the requirements of a highly constrained artificial system. 
Thus, although the model becomes biologically implausible, it is used to successfully derive a protocol for sampling in WSNs (as discussed in section _REF_).
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be as above. 
Assume that _MATH_ is identically zero and define _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ be open and assume that _MATH_ is well-defined and nonzero. 
Then there exists a connected component _MATH_ of nontrivial _MATH_-pairs for _REF_ whose closure in _MATH_ meets _MATH_ and cannot be both bounded and contained in _MATH_.
For the purpose of this section, we will not discuss bulk experiments on N/V centers, but only experiments with single centers. 
Each of the bright spots in the right-hand part of Fig. _REF_ represents a single N/V center. 
While it is not possible to determine this from the image alone, which was taken by scanning confocal microscopy with a resolution of _MATH_ nm, it is possible to estimate it from the observed count rate. 
A much cleaner signature, however, if obtained by measuring the correlation function of the arrival times of the photons on the detector. 
If we measure the delays _MATH_ between the arrival times of individual photons, we find that the probability to detect a second photon immediately after the first drops to zero for short times _CITE_. 
This is easy to understand by considering that after the emission of a photon, the center is in the ground state and cannot emit another photon until it has absorbed one.
Consequently, for a source object _MATH_ and an operation _MATH_, we have the arrow _MATH_ in this action-category as, for example, the arrow _MATH_. 
Notice that in such an action-category the nidification of (unary) operators in a given term can be simply represented as a composition of arrows. 
For instance, the term _MATH_, can be equivalently represented as the following composition of three arrows _MATH_.
The time period computation proceeds by adding up the times taken for a phase point to traverse each of the individual segments of the computed limit cycle curve. 
That is, _MATHDISP_, where each path-dependent integral is evaluated along the (spline-interpolated) limit cycle, and _MATH_ is the variable speed of the phase point along the limit cycle (i.e, the magnitude of the vector field). 
Rewriting the above in terms of the index-based variable used in the paper, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a continuous variable of integration and _MATH_ by periodicity. 
We have evaluated the above integrals using the elementary midpoint rule, because hundreds of points on the limit cycle are available.
We need some definitions. 
We say that a hyperplane supports _MATH_ if it has non-empty intersection with the boundary of _MATH_ and empty intersection with the interior of _MATH_.
The frequency modulation (FM) spectrum of the laser beam is detected by a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer with an FSR of 1 GHz, and is monitored on an oscilloscope. 
The FM spectrum is analyzed by a computer program to locate the peaks, unfold the folded 1 GHz spectrum and calculate the modulation index (see Fig. 2).
We take the flat potential _MATH_ as initial potential and the Fermi energy _MATH_ a.u.. 
At _MATH_ a gate voltage _MATH_ a.u. abruptly lowers the potential in the center. 
In addition, a time-dependent bias is applied to the left lead as _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_, where _MATH_ a.u..
Our engineered rasterization program shares with _CITE_ a fundamental design feature: the edge equation based rasterization has been replaced by individual point-in-triangle tests. 
In section _REF_, we justify the substantially lower cost of the latter when few points have to be tested, and since point-in-triangle tests are independent, it allows individual shader rasterization threads to be executed in parallel for each fragment with no inter-thread communication. 
The required face culling test is also performed as part of the rasterization program, but at no cost in our approach using the powerful SIMD instructions.
1) For each face, compute a new face point as the average of all of the old points of the face (See Fig. _REF_(a)).
The role of manoeuvres has been ignored and the analysis accordingly restricted to limited durations (shorter than two years). 
Clearly, these limitations have to be overcome if we aim at a realistic analysis of the Pioneer data: in the actual motion of the probe, manoeuvres take place roughly twice a year, and their precise characterization is known to be crucial for the quality of Doppler data reduction. 
Furthermore, their effects are correlated to that of the IC. 
It is certainly necessary to introduce manoeuvres in the simulation process for analyzing Pioneer data on the long periods over which they are available. 
Then, the diurnal modulations of the Doppler signal associated with Earth rotation also play an important role in the Pioneer data reduction. 
The rms of the residuals, which is minimized by data analysis software, indeed contains diurnal components besides annual and semiannual ones _CITE_. 
The results of ongoing further investigations, using the simulation tool to study in particular the roles of manoeuvres and diurnal modulations, will be discussed in future work.
Physics-based models capable of integrating conservation equations produce dynamo model forecasts. They can include data-assimilation models. 
This was the first time predictions in this category are available. 
The two most complete models, by _CITE_ and _CITE_, predict high and low solar activity, respectively. 
_CITE_ discuss the progress and problems in using these models for predictions of solar activity.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
In Sect. 2, the nonlinear energy resource system is presented and the synchronization issue with stochastic noises is formulated. 
In Sect. 3, an adaptive control approach with partial states is proposed, several sufficient conditions have been obtained for synchronization between two nonlinear energy resource systems with noise perturbation. 
Furthermore, stochastic robust synchronization in the presence of parameter mismatches is also considered. 
In Sect. 4, an illustrative example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. 
At last, this paper completes with a conclusion.
As a consequence of Theorem _REF_ we will prove the following:
Voronoi diagrams have been the subject of a tremendous amount of research. 
For points under the Euclidean metric, these diagrams and their complexities are well understood and optimal algorithms as well as robust and efficient implementations exist for computing them in any dimension (see for instance _CITE_). 
Such diagrams, whose bisectors are hyperplanes, are called affine diagrams.
In addition, we can eliminate all existencial quantifiers. 
However, the formula resulting from the so-called Skolemization is no longer equivalent to the output formula. 
Its satisfiability, however, remains unchanged. 
In many cases, especially when one wants to show the unsatisfiability of _MATH_, this is sufficient. 
The following formula in prenex normal form will now be skolemized: _MATHDISP_. 
Because the variable _MATH_ apparently depends on _MATH_ and _MATH_, every occurene of _MATH_ is replaced by a Skolem function _MATH_. 
It is important that _MATH_ is a new function symbol that has not yet appeared in the formula. 
We obtain _MATHDISP_ and replace _MATH_ analogously by _MATH_, which leads to _MATHDISP_ 
Because now all the variales are universally quantified, the universal quantifiers can be left out, resulting in _MATHDISP_.
The hard X-ray time profiles of most solar eruptive events begin with an impulsive phase which may be followed by a late gradual phase. 
In a recent article (Aurass et al. 2013, Astron. 
Astrophys. 
555, A40) we analyzed the impulsive phase of the solar eruptive event on November 3, 2003 in radio and X-ray emission. 
We find evidence of magnetic breakout reconnection using the radio diagnostic of the common effect of the flare current sheet and, at heights of _MATH_0.4 R_MATH_, of a coronal breakout current sheet (a source site that we call X).
Oil and gas reservoirs or subsurface aquifers are complex heterogeneous natural structures. 
They are characterized by means of several direct or indirect field measurements involving different physical processes operating at various spatial and temporal scales. 
For example, drilling wells provides small plugs whose physical properties may be measured in the laboratory. 
At a larger scale, seismic techniques provide a characterization of the geological structures. 
In some cases these techniques can help characterize the spatial fluid distribution, whose knowledge can in turn be used to improve the oil recovery strategy. 
In practice, these measurements are always expensive. 
In addition, due to their indirect and incomplete character, the measurements cannot give an exhaustive description of the reservoir and several uncertainties still remain. 
Quantification of these uncertainties is essential when setting up a reservoir development scenario and when modelling the risks due to the cost of the associated field operations. 
Within this framework, devising strategies that allow one to set up optimal data acquisition schemes can have many applications in oil or gas reservoir engineering, or in the _MATH_ geological storages. 
In this paper we present a method allowing us to quantify the information that is potentially provided by any set of measurements. 
Using a Bayesian framework, the information content of any set of data is defined by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between posterior and prior density distributions. 
In the case of a Gaussian model where the data depends linearly on the parameters, explicit formulae are given. 
The kriging example is treated, which allows us to find an optimal well placement. 
The redundancy of data can also be quantified, showing the role of the correlation structure of the prior model. 
We extend the approach to the permeability estimation from a well-test simulation using the apparent permeability. 
In this case, the global optimization result of the mean information criteria gives an optimal acquisition time frequency.
The study of complex networks is a truly multidisciplinary subject which covers many areas of nature, technology, and society _CITE_. 
These networks are graph-theoretic representations of complex systems in which the nodes of a graph represent the entities of the system and the links represent the relationship between them _CITE_. 
The use of the graphs for studying complex systems is not new. 
For instance, the study of social networks is a discipline with a long tradition of using graphs _CITE_ and has provided many theoretical tools that are now used in the analysis of networks in many disciplines. 
In the physical sciences graph analysis of relatively small systems has also been in use for long time. 
Some well known examples include the entire area of chemical graph theory _CITE_ and the use of the graphs in statistical mechanics _CITE_. 
Then, it is not rare that concepts arising in one discipline are rediscovered and used in another with success. 
For instance, the concept of node centrality _CITE_, which arises in the study of social networks, is now widely used in the analysis of biological, ecological, and infrastructural networks _CITE_. 
Another example is given by the Wiener index, which was introduced in 1947 _CITE_ and defined as the sum of the distances of all shortest paths in the graph representing hydrocarbon molecules. 
This index has proved to be useful in describing the boiling points and other physico-chemical properties of organic molecules _CITE_. 
The mean Wiener index is nowadays known as the average shortest-path distance and it has been instrumental in the definition of the concept of 'small-world' networks _CITE_. 
Here we are interested in analysing three concepts arising from different scientific disciplines, in the new context of complex networks. 
The first of these concepts is the resistance distance introduced in mathematical chemistry by Klein and Randic in 1993 _CITE_ on the basis of electrical network theory. 
The resistance distance is defined as the effective resistance between two nodes in a graph when a battery is connected across them and the links are considered as unit resistors. 
The second concept is the information centrality developed by Stephenson and Zelen in 1989 _CITE_, which tries to capture the information that can be transmitted between any two points in a connected network. 
The third, seemingly unrelated concept is the one of physical vibrations in a network _CITE_. 
We consider the displacement of every node in a network due to vibrations/oscillations as a measure of the perturbations that are caused by external factors such as social agitation, economic crisis and physiological conditions. 
The main objective of this work is to show that these three seemingly unrelated concepts are mathematically connected. 
Then, we can consider the physically appealing concept of the node vibration as a fundamental concept for complex networks, which is useful in defining: (i) a topological metric, e.g., the resistance distance; (ii) a node centrality, e.g., the information centrality; and (iii) a measure of node vulnerability.
It is noteworthy that the monodromy matrix is the state matrix for the discretized form of Eq. (_REF_); that is, _MATH_. 
So, it is as if the time periodic continuous system is converted into an autonomous discrete-time system with the sampling period being the minimal period _MATH_ of the original continuous system.
Finally we analyze the manycore algorithm._REF_ presents the speed-up for various grayscale video frame resolutions and GOP sizes on the GTX280 platform. 
The speed-up is computed with respect to the computational times obtained using one core of the platform Q6600 platforms plus GTX280. 
The speed-ups obtained for medium and high resolution images allows us to apply the CUDA 3D-DWT algorithm to improve the performance of a video coder based on the 3D-DWT. 
Missing data in_REF_ corresponds to the case where the required global memory is greater than the memory available in the GTX280 (_MATH_). 
This fact confirms the importance of the in-place computation of our algorithm.
Then, for any compact set _MATH_, there exists _MATH_ such that, for all _MATH_: _MATHDISP_, which shows that _MATH_ agrees with Definition _REF_. 
Let _MATH_ come from _REF_. 
Then, the hybrid system _MATH_ with data _MATH_ formed as _REF_ is the weak average for the PWM closed-loop control system in _REF_.
This paper is devoted to the detailed presentation of this algorithm, called the constrained LHS (cLHS). 
In the next section, we introduce this algorithm by giving some examples. 
We compare it with a SRS-based algorithm and illustrate the algorithmic performances. 
In the third section, we explain in details the cLHS algorithm. 
As the inequality constraints can be too stringent to find a cLHS, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition proving its existence from an initial LHS. 
Then, our methodology is applied on a real problem involving welding simulation models. 
A conclusion gives finally some prospects to improve the cLHS algorithm.
Li, Nieto and Shen [4] studied the existence of at least one positive periodic solutions of (1.1), (1.2) with _MATH_ is a constant). 
By using Schaeffer's fixed point theorem, they got the Solvability under _MATH_ satisfied at most linear growth and _MATH_ is bounded or _MATH_ is bounded and _MATH_ satisfied at most linear growth.
The function _MATH_ satisfies the following estimates: _MATHDISP_. 
_MATH_. 
Case _MATH_. 
By _MATH_, Lemma 2 and noticing that _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Case _MATH_. 
Derivative both sides of _MATH_ with respect to _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
By Remark 2, Lemma 2 and the eatimate of _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATHDISP_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
We suppose that _MATHDISP_ holds where _MATH_. 
We will prove (_REF_) also holds where _MATH_.
Figure _REF_, left, contains one 8-region forming a simple digital curve. 
But this curve does not separate two white 8-regions. 
Assuming 4-adjacency then we have isolated pixels, thus no simple curve, and thus there should be no separation. 
But, we do have two separated 4-regions. 
Thus, using the same adjacency relation for both black and white pixels leads to a topological result which does not correspond to the Jordan-Brouwer theorem in the Euclidean plane, and thus not to our intuition when detecting a simple curve in an image. 
The straightforward solution is:
The preliminary results on robustness of hybrid dynamical systems include that forward pre-completeness from a compact set _MATH_ (Definition _REF_) for system _MATH_, with disturbances coming from an equi-essentially bounded set, implies that the reachable set of solutions starting from the set _MATH_ for system _MATH_ is compact. 
Moreover, for each solution _MATH_ starting from the set _MATH_ of its inflated system _MATH_ there exists a solution _MATH_ of system _MATH_ such that they are _MATH_-close (Definition _REF_), see _CITE_. 
They also include the results on robust stability properties of the inflated system _MATH_ with the assumption that the actual system _MATH_ is input-to-state stable (Definition _REF_) in _CITE_. 
Without the convex condition for the flow mapping _MATH_ with respect to disturbances in Assumption _REF_, _CITE_ shows that above preliminary results may not be preserved.
It is well known that the information about the neuron states is often incomplete from the network measurements (outputs) in applications, we assume that the network measurements satisfy _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the measurement output; _MATH_ and _MATH_ are known constant matrices with appropriate dimensions. 
Further, the activation functions satisfy the following assumptions
 (H1) For any _MATH_, there exist constants _MATH_- and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
The fact that _MATH_ for _MATH_ comes from concavity and strict monotonicity. 
Moreover if _MATH_ in an interval _MATH_, then on this interval _MATH_ is constant (say equal to _MATH_) and _MATH_. 
Therefore for _MATH_, the HJB equation _REF_ becomes _MATHDISP_, which is impossible since _MATH_ is strictly concave. 
Now let _MATH_ be such that _MATH_. 
In this case the maximum of _MATH_ is reached for _MATH_, and so we have from the HJB equation _REF_ for _MATH_ in a sufficiently small neighborhood _MATH_ of _MATH_ that _MATHDISP_. 
Define for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
Clearly _MATH_ has a local maximum at _MATH_ and is twice differentiable at _MATH_ thanks to Remark _REF_. 
So it must be that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We have _MATHDISP_, and therefore, using that _MATH_, we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_ is also a maximum for _MATH_, we clearly have _MATH_ and consequently _MATH_ by Hypothesis _REF_ (i), a contradiction.
It is straightforward to verify that our assumptions on the action of _MATH_ on _MATH_ imply that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ for matrices _MATH_, where the vectors _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ can be efficiently computed as follows: _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ denotes the column vector with _MATH_ zero-entries.
Among novel emerging technologies Direct Laser Writing (DLW) could be distinguished as a promising approach for 3D scaffold fabrication _CITE_. 
Apart from the unique possibility to fabricate predesigned true 3D structures at nano- to microscale, it offers flexibility, ease of use, and cost effectiveness in processing _CITE_. 
Compared to _MATH_-stereolithography _CITE_ or electron beam lithography _CITE_ this technique offers rapid patterning, compromising between performance and costs with increasing feature size. 
It also provides a unique possibility of sculpting of any 3D geometry features _CITE_. 
Finally, easily scalable structuring in various biocompatible polymers is an important advantage of DLW technique for biomedical applications _CITE_. 
Yet much effort still has to be put both in improving fabrication technology of scaffolds by DLW _CITE_ and in understanding cell behavior at micro-scale.
Suppose that there exists a unitary matrix _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for any _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then the stochastic matrix _MATH_ is unitary implementable and we can take _MATH_. 
Under this condition the set _MATH_ giving the decomposition of _MATH_ by (_REF_) becomes an ONB; _MATHDISP_. 
Thus we have the following theorem.
(a) Compute the optimal value function _MATH_ and the NMPC feedback law _MATH_ by dynamic programming.
Let _MATH_ be a simple closed polygonal curve on a convex surface _MATH_, and let _MATH_ be any point of one (closed) half-surface _MATH_ bounded by _MATH_, but not on _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be one of the points of _MATH_ closest to _MATH_. 
Then for any choice of _MATH_, the angle _MATH_ made by _MATH_ with _MATH_ at _MATH_ is at least _MATH_. 
In particular, if _MATH_ is not a corner of _MATH_ then _MATH_ and the path _MATH_ is unique as shortest between _MATH_ and _MATH_, and _MATH_ occurs only at corners _MATH_ where the angle of _MATH_ toward _MATH_ is larger than _MATH_.
Our enhanced Pomeron formalism, is based on the observation that the soft scattering cross sections and slopes, can be reproduced with _MATH_, rather than _MATH_ typical of conventional Regge phenomenology. 
Our result of a very small _MATH_, implies that the observed shrinkage of the forward differential cross sections, traditionally associated with _MATH_, can be also reproduced with _MATH_ coupled to strong screening, which produces the desired shrinkage.
Contrary to [M05], the approach followed here is based on a "variational principle" allowing for metastable states and is also different from other (besides elegant) variational approaches like the one in [FM] (the appropriate version of such an approach in the case of complex bodies is also discussed in Sect. 6), which has been source of various analytical studies as [DM-T] and [DMFT] (see also [Ol04], for other variational treatments).
Rather than give plots of the current _MATH_-mode and _MATH_-mode results in comparison with the expected power spectra, we simply note that recent results from the QUAD experiment at the South Pole (_CITE_) show that the expected peak structure in the _MATH_-mode at scales between about 200 to 2000 in _MATH_ (see Fig. _REF_) has been definitely detected, at high significance, and that recent results from BICEP (also at the South Pole), give a direct limit to the _MATH_ mode level of _MATH_ at 95% confidence (_CITE_). 
We note that this is much larger than the limit of _MATH_ at 95% given by _CITE_, and used in Fig. _REF_. 
This is because the latter is not a direct limit, but comes via a combination of constraints from _MATH_ and _MATH_ mode CMB, together with large scale structure data and supernovae. 
_CITE_ show that the direct upper limit on _MATH_-modes from WMAP data is _MATH_, i.e. considerably larger again.
With Theorem B(1) at hand, we can complete the proof of Theorem A. 
Suppose _MATH_. 
Observe that _MATH_ and it is well known that _MATH_ is isomorphic to the coinvariant algebra of the symmetric group _MATH_. 
Hence by _CITE_ and (_REF_) we obtain that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the shifted Young diagram associated to _MATH_ and _MATH_ are contents and shifted hook lengths for a cell _MATH_, respectively. 
This together with Theorem B(1) gives rise to _MATHDISP_, where the last equality can be derived by noting that the contents _MATH_ are _MATH_ and the fact (cf. _CITE_) that in the _MATH_th row of _MATH_, the hook lengths _MATH_ for _MATH_ are _MATH_ with exception _MATH_.
As the second example, linearly coupled dynamical networks with BA scale-free topology is simulated. 
The generation scheme of BA scale-free network is referred to Ref._CITE_. 
In this numerical example, the chaotic Lorenz system (_REF_) is also chosen as the nodes of the dynamical network. 
The nodes of dynamical network are linearly coupled in the following way _CITE_: _MATH_ and _MATH_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the inner coupling matrix for two connected nodes, _MATH_ is the coupling configuration matrix representing the topological structure of the network, in which _MATH_ is defined as follows: if there is a connection between node _MATH_ and node _MATH_ (_MATH_), then _MATH_; otherwise, _MATH_ _MATH_, and the diagonal elements of matrix _MATH_ are defined by _MATH_. 
It is similar for the matrix _MATH_. 
In the numerical simulation, the coupling matrix _MATH_ and delayed coupling matrix _MATH_ are both come from BA scale-free topologies which are constructed with _MATH_ and _MATH_ _CITE_, and the parameters are respectively taken as _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
As we have discussed, Assumption _REF_ holds for the Lorenz system, and Assumption _REF_ is true for linearly coupled networks, thus the feedback control term (_REF_) and update law (_REF_) with _MATH_ can be utilized to synchronize the dynamical network to synchronous solution _MATH_. 
In the simulation, the initial values of the isolate systems are randomly generated between -5 and 5. 
Figure _REF_ clearly shows that the states of the scale-free coupled dynamical network well synchronize with the referenced state _MATH_ under the controller (_REF_) with the update law (_REF_). 
The trajectory of the updated feedback strength _MATH_ is given in Fig. _REF_.
In this Appendix we give a proof of the equivalence of the two perturbative methods developed in Sec. 3. 
We neglect the issue of the convergence of the bound-state expansion (_REF_).
In this section a discussion on the reviewed methodologies is presented. 
The various approaches differ with respect to several dimensions. 
In particular, the most important ones are: the software dynamics model, the performance model, the phase of the software development in which the analysis is carried out, the level of detail of the additional information needed for the analysis, and the software architecture features of the system under analysis, e.g., specific architectural patterns such as client-server, and others.
By rewriting Eq.(_REF_) as _MATHDISP_, we display the evolution of _MATH_ versus _MATH_ in Fig._REF_ with _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
From Fig._REF_, we know that _MATH_ approaches _MATH_ in the future, which confirms the qualitative analysis. 
With _MATH_, we find that the curve representing the current value of _MATH_ defined in Eq.(_REF_) versus _MATH_ with _MATH_ is just that displayed in Fig._REF_. 
So, as in the last section, from Fig._REF_ we may conclude that the EoS parameter of the dark energy (_REF_) is consistent with the WMAP observation _CITE_, as _MATH_ is taken to be a number of order ten. 
Further, with _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, we obtain the value of the shift parameter _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_. 
So the dark energy model (_REF_) with _MATH_ is in agreement with the 7-year WMAP observations (_MATH_) _CITE_.
For the autocorrelation function if we define _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ we obtain _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ 
In Eqs. (15) and (16) we take into account the differing influence of the interstellar medium on the scattering angle on either side of the thin screen, i.e. in Eq. (15) _MATH_ and in Eq. (16) we use _MATH_ as a weighting factor.
Key-Sharing in Cryptographic Distributed File System
However, in spite of the fact that constant magnetic field does not produce particles, the probability given in (_REF_) modifies to be _MATHDISP_ when a magnetic field is added to the electric one. 
Therefore a magnetic field influences significantly the creation of particles.
In Fig. _REF_, we compare our hierarchical JBTU method and multi-scale JBTU with the Gaussian upsampling and bicubic upsampling. 
Notice that compared with our method, Gaussian upsampling produces much more blurred results. 
In our experiments, we generally set the domain filter's Gaussian _MATH_ of the joint bilateral filtering operator to 0.5 with _MATH_ support. 
The range filter Gaussian _MATH_ is strongly application dependent. 
For the images with color values normalized to the [0,1] interval, setting _MATH_ to the standard deviation of the values has always given good results. 
In Fig. _REF_, it takes about 0.6 seconds to upsample the synthesized texture _MATH_ to the result _MATH_ using the multi-scale JBTU.
We analyze our stochastic ODE using methods similar to those used by Iwasa, Michor, Komarova, and Nowak _CITE_ and Durrett, Schmidt, and Schweinsberg _CITE_ in their study of cancer pathways. 
Hermisson and Pennings _CITE_ also used similar techniques in an abstract setting applicable to HIV. 
Desai and Fisher _CITE_ analyzed the dynamics of sequential selective sweeps, a model similar in spirit to our own, but they did not allow for varying population size nor did they construct genealogies. 
In all these works and our own, the dynamics of mutations present at low levels in the overall population are well approximated by branching processes. 
Rouzine and Coffin considered an HIV model that bears some similarity to our HIV-CTL model _CITE_, but their analysis and goals differ from ours.
An Interface Automaton (IA) is defined as _MATH_, where:
 _MATH_ is a set of states and _MATH_ is the initial state,
_MATH_ is a set of input and output events, where _MATH_. 
These events correspond to the ports of _MATH_, and
 _MATH_ is a set of steps.
Aside from their differences, such wave trains sometimes have considerable spatial overlap ( e.g. _CITE_) and even share some similar periods with the accompanying flare pulsations _CITE_. 
EIT wave trains detected thus far are always accompanied by funnel QFPs, but not vice versa. 
In off-limb events the QFP funnel at times gradually turns from vertical to horizontal, and the EIT wave trains travel horizontally along the solar surface.
The proof of Theorem _REF_ is similar to those of Theorem 4.1 in _CITE_, Theorems 4 and 5, in _CITE_, Theorem 6 in _CITE_ and Theorems 1, 2 and 3 in _CITE_. 
Now we write _MATHDISP_ where for convenience, _MATH_, with _MATH_, is written as _MATH_. 
We write _MATHDISP_. 
Using (_REF_) and (_REF_), we can find each _MATH_ as a linear combination of _MATH_ in which each _MATH_ is multiplied by some multiplicative combination of the _MATH_. 
O'Brien defined the "normalized" form of _MATH_. 
These normalized forms of _MATH_ can be found by substituting (_REF_) and (_REF_) into (_REF_), easily. 
We adopt the following to (4.37) in _CITE_ _MATHDISP_.
It is natural to expect that the chance of survival of a species would increase if the species increases its motility to move to other places when food is consumed. 
We model the situation using the above motility functions and consider _MATHDISP_. 
The competition model (_REF_) versus (_REF_) has been numerically tested for several cases. 
For fixed _MATH_ it is observed that there exist _MATH_ such that _MATH_ prevails if _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ may coexist if _MATH_ and _MATH_ prevails if _MATH_ (see Figures _REF_ and _REF_). 
For a case _MATH_ the linear diffuser _MATH_ always becomes extinct, Figures _REF_ and _REF_, and it is conjectured that _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ and the motility function is given by _MATH_, then it is shown that _MATH_ and hence _MATH_ always survives (see _CITE_). 
Related conjectures are given in Section _REF_. 
Analysis techniques for linear diffusion models has been extended to prove this numerically observed behavior in two companion papers _CITE_ under additional technical assumptions.
Theorem _REF_ points out strong and useful properties of NDARMA processes: i) Except Goodman and Kruskal's _MATH_, the uncertainty coefficient, and the deviance measure, all association measures _MATH_ discussed in appendix _REF_ are simple one-to-one functions of the correlation. 
ii) Each single association measure _MATH_ leads to the same concept of association measure stationarity in the sense of definition _REF_. 
iii) Association measure stationarity in the sense of ii) is equivalent to bivariate stationarity, and also equivalent to correlation stationarity. 
These properties lead to a considerable simplification both in theory and in modelling and data analysis by NDARMA processes. 
The concept of correlation stationarity, which is familiar from cardinal time series analysis, is sufficient for the understanding and for the analysis of weak stationarity of NDARMA processes.
General Metric Definition: feature values are not converted, but a metrics for computing similarity over values of different types is defined. 
The most used distance function of this kind is called Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric function (HEOM) _CITE_ and uses a weighted combination of the distance functions specific of the involved types: in particular, it combines overlap metric for nominal attributes and normalized Euclidean distance for numeric attributes. 
Several variations of the HEOM metric function have been defined _CITE_.
In fact, conservation laws of _MATH_ are _MATH_-differential forms _MATH_ on _MATH_, such that for any smooth integral _MATH_-manifold _MATH_, solution of _MATH_, one has _MATH_. 
Then, one can take the _MATH_-differential forms _MATH_, given in (_REF_). _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is a smooth function on _MATH_ and _MATH_ are arbitrary smooth functions of their arguments. 
The "widehat" over the symbols means absence of the underlying symbols. 
In fact, one has the following. _MATHDISP_
From the Assumption H1, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Then for _MATH_ and _MATH_, the following inequalities are also true: _MATHDISP_.
Note that the anisotropic Hilbert transform shows the influence of the underlying metric in two different ways: (1) the determinant of the "mother" metric _MATH_ on _MATH_ arises as an explicit factor in the expression for the kernel, and (2) the induced metric _MATH_ on _MATH_ comes into play explicitly through the denominator of the kernel, but also implicitly through its numerator since the vector _MATH_ contains the (skew) basis vectors _MATH_.
In this section, we present the result of some simulations to illustrate our methods. 
In our simulations, the data are generated from the following bivariate model _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_,_MATH_,_MATH_, _MATH_. 
_MATH_, we furthermore assume _MATH_. 
To gain an idea of the effect of the distribution of the error on our results, we take the following three different types of the error distribution whose scales are adjusted such that they all have a common variance _MATH_, (1) _MATH_, (2) _MATH_, (3) _MATH_. 
The Epanechnikov kernel _MATH_ is used in our simulation. 
Furthermore, in order to show that the performance of our proposed procedures do not depend sensitively on the choice of bandwidth, we let _MATH_ respectively.
In the first order in _MATH_, Eq. (_REF_) rewrites as _MATHDISP_. 
Substituting Eq. (_REF_), we obtain the following expression for correction to _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
The lowest-order _MATH_-dependence of the cross-section area is determined by the Fourier coefficient _MATH_ in the expansion (_REF_). 
Performing the integration over _MATH_, we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
To go further, we need to specify the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_.
At the same time, Hayden's analysis is in some ways very pessimistic. 
For example, he found that ProbabilisticSend is so reliable if IP multicast succeeds that he ended up focused on the case where IP multicast is sometimes a complete failure and nobody receives the initial multicast. 
This leads to a sort of extreme scenario in which some messages are essentially delivered reliably system-wide in the first phase, while others are n't delivered at all until the gossip mechanism kicks in. 
Realistic runs of ProbabilisticSend live somewhere in between these extremes, but are hard to analyze using the style of closed form recurrence relations Hayden employed in his investigation. 
As a result, in what follows we'll use Hayden's analysis to derive worst case bounds, and experimental studies to understand the normal case that might be seen in real deployments of ProbabilisticSend.
These new results demonstrate observable manifestations of crucial modifications to the physics of type III bursts due to the presence of suprathermal background particles in the corona. 
We find that in a _MATH_-distributed background corona, the electron beam, beam-Langmuir wave interactions, and nonlinear wave-wave interactions that lead to emission of type III bursts take place primarily at larger phase speeds and smaller wavenumbers than in a Maxwellian plasma. 
The new results may resolve longstanding issues regarding the speeds of coronal type III beams and the production of remotely observable levels of _MATH_ emission despite heavy losses in the corona. 
The simulations also suggest that the distributions of coronal background electrons should be _MATH_-like (with _MATH_) and the injected electrons should have power-law spectra, at least when type III bursts associated with fast beams (_MATH_) are observed.
Acting on (_REF_) with _MATH_, we find that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is given by (_REF_) and _MATHDISP_. 
Thus for the projected integrability condition to be consistent with the equations of motion, we must have _MATH_, implying that _MATHDISP_. 
We now examine the projected integrability condition for (_REF_). 
we find _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
It is easy to see that the solution (_REF_) with _MATH_ satisfy the equation _MATH_. 
Thus, the scalar potential is precisely the conformal anomaly term provided that the non-vanishing constant _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_. 
Thus we demonstrate that the presence of the conformal anomaly term does not spoil the existence of the consistent Killing spinor equations. 
Furthermore, the conformal anomaly term is the only scalar potential that we can add to the bosonic string such that Killing spinor equations remain consistent. 
The result confirms the suggestion that there is an underlying generalized geometric structure associated with Killing spinor equations in string theory, whether it is supersymmetric or not, critical or non-critical.
From the analysis in Sect. III and the above figures, we can see that the numerical results correspond perfectly to our theoretical findings, that is to say, there are a range of parameters where different spatial patterns emerge. 
More specifically, typical dynamics of population density variation, i.e., stripelike or spotted or coexistence of both, which are the formation of isolated groups, are obtained.
The parameter _MATH_ is the desired peak absorbance value and _MATH_ the formula by Arndt _CITE_, which is the harmonic spectrum of a peak normalized unsaturated Lorentzian function. 
The _MATH_ are random variables representing the measurement noise. 
The parameters describing the relationship between index _MATH_ and _MATH_ (i.e. offset and proportionality factor) cannot be determined from the fit when only a single absorption line with unknown line width is scanned.
A discrete Lagrangian _MATH_ is said to be regular if the Poincare-Cartan 2-section _MATH_ is nondegenerate on the Lie algebroid _MATH_ (see _CITE_). 
In _CITE_, we obtained some necessary and sufficient conditions for a discrete Lagrangian on a Lie groupoid _MATH_ to be regular that we summarize as follows: _MATHDISP_ Locally, we deduce that _MATH_ is regular if and only if for every _MATH_ and every local basis _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_) of _MATH_ on an open subset _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_) of _MATH_ such that _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_) we have that the matrix _MATH_ is regular on _MATH_.

An optical path of 310cm (31 passes) is achieved with a 2.9 incidence angle. 
A 650nm laser is used to visualize the optical path and to align the spherical mirrors.
The magnetic fields affect collapse of molecular cloud cores. 
Here, we consider a collapsing core with an axial magnetic field and investigate its effect on infall of matter and formation of accretion disk. 
For this purpose, the equations of motion of ions and neutral infalling particles are numerically solved to obtain the streamlines of trajectories. 
The results show that in non-steady state of ionization and ion-neutral coupling, which is not unexpected in the case of infall, the radius of accretion disk will be larger as a consequence of axial magnetic field.
Proof. 
Replace _MATH_ and _MATH_ in the LMI (6) with _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, then the LMI (6) can be rewritten as _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
By Lemma 2, (28) follows directly.
In the conclusions, we critically compare our results with other approaches, and summarize our findings. 
We list a few experimental signatures, which should enable us to differentiate between alternative theoretical options and phenomenological models.
The equation (1.3) has been studied extensively by many authors, and there is a large literature on the existence and multiplicity of results of solutions for the equation (1.3), for example, we refer the readers to see [1,14,17] and references therein.
We have studied optoelectronic properties of photonic nanowires doped with an ensemble of four-level nanoparticles. 
Nanowires are made from two photonic crystals A and B where crystal A is embedded in B. Photons are confined with the photonic nanowire due to the band structure engineering of crystals A and B. 
A probe field is applied to monitor the absorption spectrum and a control field is applied to shift the position of absorption peak. 
It is considered that nanoparticles are interacting with bound photon states of the nanowire. 
It is found that the number of bound states in the wire depends on the size and the energy depth of the wire. 
It is also found that when the resonance energy lies near the bound state of the system goes from absorbing state to the transparent state. 
This is due to the strong coupling between nanoparticles and bound photons in the wire. 
The control field switches the system from the transparent state to the absorbing state by changing the location of the resonance energy. 
The present findings can be used to make new types optoelectronic switches.
In contrast to DeMiguel et al (2009b) our statistical methodology for comparing the different out-of-sample performances does not require that the data are normally distributed and serially independent. 
Any testing procedure which is based on the normal distribution hypothesis and the assumption of serial independence might lead to wrong conclusions (Frahm 2007; Lo 2002; Ledoit and Wolf 2008). 
By contrast, we apply a stationary block bootstrap procedure to account for the serial dependence structure of the out-of-sample portfolio returns. 
As this is a non-parametric method, the normality assumption is not required either.
This paper provides a comprehensive survey for activity recognition in video surveillance. 
It starts with a description of simple and complex human activity, and various applications. 
The applications of activity recognition are manifold, ranging from visual surveillance through content based retrieval to human computer interaction. 
The organization of this paper covers all aspects of the general framework of human activity recognition. 
Then, it summarizes and categorizes recent-published research progresses under a general framework. 
Finally, this paper also provides an overview of benchmark databases for activity recognition, the market analysis of video surveillance, and future directions to work on for this application.
The design of two-degree-of-freedom controller is done taking as input to the controller the vector _MATH_ instead of the vector _MATH_ as in the case of one degree-of-freedom.
The capacitated lot sizing problem is solved to optimality considering (_MATH_) aggregate capacity, and (_MATH_) estimated setup times. 
The size of production lots for one period ahead are taken as input to a detailed scheduling routine. 
It is an unrelated parallel machines with sequence dependent setup times scheduling problem which we solve by heuristic methods. 
Lot sizing decision for the subsequent periods are reevaluated conditioned to the production lots that could not be completed within the period scheduled. 
The procedure iterates in this fashion until lot sizing decisions have been consolidated by detailed shop floor scheduling information for the whole planning horizon.
(ii) if _MATH_, model _REF_ has three nonnegative equilibria _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
The equilibria _MATH_ and _MATH_ are asymptotically stable and _MATH_ is unstable. 
Solutions of _REF_ with initial data in _MATH_ are generically convergent to either _MATH_ or _MATH_.
Proof of the claim. 
Since _MATH_, it is clear that _MATH_. 
For any _MATH_, we deal with cases a), b) and c) separately.
Let _MATH_ be a curve in _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_. 
Now, let _MATH_ be a curve in _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_. 
Finally, let _MATH_ be a curve in _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_. 
For the first inequality, denote _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
From Proposition _REF_, this is less than or equal to _MATHDISP_, as wanted.
In the Dragon protocol there are several possible sources of data inconsistency:
The linear schemes studied so far have known limits. 
For example, one might object to the idea of offering a flat benefit to all households even the wealthiest. 
It is quite clear that this is hard to defend, except for reasons of political sustainability. 
In this section we introduce nonlinear tools that would allow for self-selecting individuals, thus avoiding that such a benefit goes to everyone even to those who can afford either insurance or self-insurance. 
Administrative simplicity, take-up and "strategic impoverishment" (through inter-vivos gifts) are other arguments, particularly against means-tested schemes (and means-testing is often used to implement non-linear benefit schemes). 
A more detailed discussion of these issues is provided at the end of this sections.
Most of existing results of FD for NCS are only employed the discrete-time system to model the NCS. 
But it is difficult for nonlinear NCS to obtain the exact discrete controlled plant under the conditions of network-induced delays and packets loss. 
For this problem, Euler approximate method is commonly used, which leads to an approximate NCS model as in _CITE_, _CITE_. 
On the other hand, some control theories, such as stability analysis using Lyapunov function or adaptive observer design for discrete-time systems are not so matured yet as that for continuous-time systems, and the extension work is not easy. 
It can be solved by using other techniques, such as sliding mode control theory _CITE_, instead of Lyapunov function.
By Prohorov's theorem (cf. Billingsley _CITE_), the relative compactness of _MATHDISP_ follows from Proposition _REF_. 
Thus, observing that _MATHDISP_, we have the relative compactness of _MATHDISP_. 
( Indeed, in view of Lemma _REF_, _MATH_ are i.i.d. w.r.t. _MATH_ for each _MATH_. 
Thus, according to the central limit theorem, for each _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ converges to some proper limit w.r.t. _MATH_ as _MATH_ goes to infinity, while _MATHDISP_ as _MATH_, w.r.t. _MATH_ for each _MATH_. 
Therefore the first term in the righthand of (_REF_) converges to 0 as _MATH_ goes to infinity. )
The output touch actuation system consists of air bags which inflate and deflate according to the remote input while maintaining the pressure in a constant level. 
Overall remote hugging jacket consists of 12 individual air pouches which corresponds to each of the 12 sensors on the input doll as shown in Figure _REF_. 
Figure _REF_ show the individual air pouch with its controlling air actuation module.
In order now to prove the first assertion above, let us reduce the situation to the local one, that is, when _MATH_ is a neighborhood _MATH_ of the origin in _MATH_. 
One can assume that _MATH_ (defined in _MATH_ as the common zero set of holomorphic functions _MATH_ in _MATH_) is the union of a finite number of irreducible components of the complete intersection _MATH_, with _MATH_ on each such component (_CITE_, p. 72). 
Let _MATH_ be a linear combination of _MATH_ which does not vanish identically on any of the irreducible components of the complete intersection _MATH_, which are not irreducible components of _MATH_. 
We introduce from now on the notation _MATH_ to denote the union of the irreducible components of _MATH_ which are not entirely contained in _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be an holomorphic function in _MATH_ such that _MATH_ and _MATH_ on any irreducible component of _MATH_. 
Let us introduce the differential _MATH_ form _MATHDISP_, and the _MATH_-closed _MATH_ current _MATHDISP_, where the current _MATH_ is defined by the iterated process _MATHDISP_ considered in the proof of Proposition _REF_ where also the notation _MATH_ was introduced. 
Using Bernstein-Sato equation _REF_ (here for _MATH_ functions), still in its conjugate form, one can prove that the current valued function _MATHDISP_ can be continued from _MATHDISP_ to a product a half-planes _MATHDISP_ for some _MATH_. 
Moreover, when _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, the value at _MATH_ of _MATHDISP_ is equal to the current _MATHDISP_. 
Keeping _MATH_ and _MATH_ and taking the analytic continuation in _MATH_ up to _MATH_, we get precisely the current _MATHDISP_.
Highly symmetric tight frames (and finite reflection groups)
Proof: Rearranging (_REF_) as _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ Applying Schur complement on (_REF_) we get _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Multiplying (_REF_) to the right by the matrix _MATH_ and the left by its transpose, we obtain (_REF_) with _MATH_ at the place of _MATH_.
Several color spaces have been suggested for general skin color modeling, but thus far, none of them has been shown to be superior to the other. 
The list of comparison studies for color spaces can be found, e.g. in _CITE_ or _CITE_. 
However, it seems that those spaces in which intensity is not separated so clearly from chromaticity are similar to RGB. 
The separation can be evaluated using linear or linearized RGB data: RGB is transformed into color space using substitution _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, in which c describes a uniform change in the intensity levels. 
If the factor c does not cancel out for chromaticity descriptors, the separation is incomplete.
SO(10) GUT model is very predictive not only because its genuine unification of all the standard model gauge couplings but also because all the standard model matter contents within each generation can be filled into one _MATH_ dimensional spinor representation. 
Due to its highly predictive nature (very few parameters), ordinary Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism cannot be used in such 4D SO(10) GUT models to give the realistic standard model flavor structure. 
However, it is possible to use Generalized Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism in 4D SO(10) GUT models to obtain the realistic hierarchical flavor structure. 
We consider the following _MATH_ invariant non-renormalizable Lagrangian _MATHDISP_. with the _MATH_ charge assignment _MATH_. 
Again, the coefficients _MATH_ which correspond to different contractions in the group production are _MATH_ parameters. 
We also assume universality for each coefficients that corresponds to different contractions _MATHDISP_.
In this section we will briefly review Collins-Soper fragmentation function in vacuum which is widely used at _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_- colliders. 
Consider a scalar gluon, for example, with four momentum _MATH_ in vacuum fragmenting to a hadron with four momentum _MATH_. 
For application to collider experiments it is convenient to use light cone quantization formalism. 
The scalar gluon field _MATH_ can be written as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the creation and annihilation operators respectively. 
_MATH_ where _MATH_ is the space dimension. 
The single particle parton state is given by _MATHDISP_ with the normalization _MATHDISP_.
The example in Figure _REF_ evidently shows concurrent arrivals of an EIT wave and onsets of oscillations of various local structures. 
These oscillations occur in a broad range of periods - 12 - 15 minutes in low-altitude (short) loops, 28 minutes in a filament-hosting coronal cavity, and 56 - 80 minutes in high-altitude (long) loops-which are positively correlated with loop lengths and thus suggestive of fast kink modes. 
They have initial amplitudes of 2 - 20 Mm, velocity amplitudes of 8 - _MATH_, and e-folding damping times of 1 - 7 periods. 
In another example shown in Figure _REF_ (left, near _MATH_), the initial large-amplitude loop displacement appears as a short-lived secondary intensity front that bifurcates from the primary wave and lags behind at _MATH_ of its speed. 
Such fronts differ from the secondary waves at coronal bright points that emerge ahead of the primary waves at greater speeds, as mentioned above in Section _REF_.
Next we focus on invader density within the width of the advancing front, to compare stochastic and deterministic invasion models in a general context. 
We constructed density profiles for the invader along the horizontal direction (averaged over rows _MATH_, for a given _MATH_): _MATHDISP_. 
The density profile should spread horizontally in response to the front's roughening (as a function of time during growth phase, and as a function of habitat size in steady state). 
Figure _REF_(a) shows the invader's steady-state density profiles as a function of distance from the front's mean position. 
Profiles are averaged over _MATH_ time steps, and plotted for a series of habitat sizes _MATH_. 
Behind the front, where the resident has been excluded, invader density _MATH_ rests at its single-species equilibrium _MATH_. 
Invader density declines through the width, and only the resident occupies locations well right of the front.
In this paper, we study relatively simple toy models to determine the frequency dependence of the travel-times shifts due to local changes in background sound-speed. 
Our approach is carry out numerical simulations of the propagation of small-amplitude waves through heterogeneous background models. 
Wave travel times are then measured from these artificial wavefields using surface-focusing HH. 
Using this approach, we can study the frequency dependence of wave travel times for various types of local variations in sound speed.
Assume a strip with a lateral structure M1/M2/M1, where M1 and M2 are two different materials with different Fermi energies _MATH_ and lengths _MATH_ and _MATH_ and where the electrical current passes through them. 
Because of the different _MATH_'s between M1 and M2, the one particle potential can be described by a barrier _MATH_ of length _MATH_ in M2 that acts as a potential well where the wave function behaves coherently having multireflections, i.e. a kind of Fabry-Perot interferometer for electrons, a problem studied recently for the case of fluctuations in the magnetoresistance of graphene _CITE_. 
Inset in Fig. 1(a) shows the one-dimensional geometry of the system with the barrier _MATH_ depending on the potential drop between the two ends of the trilayer. 
The transmittivity along such structure is _CITE_ _MATHDISP_. 
The parameters in (_REF_) are: _MATH_ is the energy of the incoming particles forming an angle _MATH_ to the interface, _MATH_ the electronic mass and _MATH_. 
Applying a potential to the trilayer the potential in M2 is _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
The solution to this problem can be obtained as combination of Airy functions _CITE_. 
A good approximation is to take the trapezoidal rule, i.e. _MATH_ and calculate _MATH_ following (_REF_) as shown in Fig. 1(a). 
Interference effects require ballistic transport in the potential region M2 with conveniently flat interfaces to avoid multiple reflections. 
We will use M2 as a superconductor (S) or as normal metal (N) and vice versa for M1, of appropriate lengths.
Scheduling of both typical batch tasks and advance reservations in a single resource management system is a challenge, especially if a hierarchical scheduling structure is considered. 
As it was presented in Section _REF_, ARs heavily impact utilization and execution of remaining tasks in the system. 
Similarly, non-AR tasks may also significantly influence setting ARs. 
Due to these issues, administrators of LRMSs often prefer to avoid advance reservations. 
Therefore, we attempt to provide a model and method which could efficiently manage both types of tasks. 
We assumed (based on solutions applied in most of LRMSs) that for all tasks the processing time limit is set. 
This limit can be set by end-users during task submission or, if not, by LRMS according to configuration of particular queues. 
Length of advance reservations is given by users.
Consider the projective bundle _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the projection in _REF_. 
Since _MATH_ (see Proposition _REF_), there is a vector bundle _MATHDISP_ such that _MATH_ is the projective bundle _MATH_ parametrizing the lines in _MATH_. 
Fix one such vector bundle _MATH_.
In cameras, white balancing can be done automatically or manually. 
In manual selection, the user selects the best option for the prevailing illumination, while automatic option provides settings from a program. 
However, it is not always possible to select or compute proper white balancing factors. 
This is especially true under varying, nonuniform illumination, which can cause more drastic color changes. 
For example, it is common to have more than one light source on a scene. 
If these sources with different SPDs shine over an object, it is not possible to conduct the correct white balancing for the whole image. 
This is demonstrated in Fig. _REF_. 
The face is imaged under a non-uniform illumination field. 
The camera was balanced under the light of fluorescent lamps on the ceiling and thus the part of the face under only fluorescent illumination field appears in skin tones. 
However, the daylight from windows causes a bluish color shift on the right side of the face image. 
The colors are distorted because the white balancing fails partially. 
The distortion between these two sides varies to a different degree as a function of illumination field. 
The non-uniform illumination fields are encountered commonly, but they are rarely considered in face detection or recognition applications.
When searching large graphs that cannot be fully contained in memory, DFS suffers from non-termination when the length of a path in the search tree is infinite. 
The simple solution of "remember which nodes I have already seen" does n't always work because there can be insufficient memory. 
This can be solved by maintaining an increasing limit on the depth of the tree, which is called iterative deepening depth-first search.
In this subsection, we approximate the set of eigenvalues of the transition matrix _MATH_ defined in Eq. _REF_ by a series expansion in terms of the non-dimensional parameter _MATH_. 
As is well known, eigenvalues of _MATH_ are obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_. 
Expanding _MATH_ and omitting the _MATH_ terms, we find _MATHDISP_.
In _CITE_, a model of erythropoiesis subject to malaria infection was developed by combining the approaches in _CITE_ towards erythropoiesis and the approach in _CITE_ towards malaria. 
Through numerous simulations, it was shown that the model was most sensitive to the number of new parasites released per bursting infected erythrocyte _MATH_. 
In this work, we will investigate this further. 
While _MATH_ was assumed to be constant in _CITE_, this value could clearly vary during treatment. 
In fact, in most treatments of malaria infection (including quinine) where the effective mechanism of the medication is known, it is by inhibiting some reproductive function of the parasites within infected red blood cells. 
Now, if seeking an optimal treatment only meant keeping the parasitic load at a minimum and the erythrocyte level as close to normal as possible, then applying massive doses of an effective medication would be a viable solution. 
But, there are costs associated with medication. 
Other than the obvious monetary costs, there is also the issue of unwanted side effects that result from overdosing. 
Using the ideas of parameter estimation and optimization in _CITE_, we formulate an optimization problem that seeks to find a function _MATH_ that addresses both the health of the individual being treated and the cost of medicating.
To obtain abundance estimates of a population of interest using distance sampling methods, lines or points may be placed in the study area according to some design _CITE_. 
Each line or point is surveyed at least once following the distance sampling protocol where the observer travels along the line (line transects) or remains at the point for a fixed amount of time (point transects). 
Detections are recorded along with the perpendicular distance from the line to the detection or radial distance from the point to the detection. 
These distances may be recorded exactly or in predetermined distance intervals. 
Thus, surveys of this type produce two types of data: firstly, the observed distances _MATH_ with _MATH_ (_MATH_ being the total number of detections) or observed distances _MATH_ in each of _MATH_ distance intervals (where _MATH_); secondly, the observed number of detections or counts _MATH_ at line or point _MATH_ along with the effort data which at bare minimum consists of the size of the search area. 
In case detections are made of single animals, the observed counts at the line (point) are equivalent to the number of detections at the line (point). 
These two types of data, distances and counts, give rise to the two components of the integrated likelihood described in this section. 
However, if detections are made of groups of animals (rather than single individuals), a third type of data generated from a distance sampling survey is cluster size _MATH_ which represents the number of individuals within the _MATH_th detected group. 
For simplicity, we ignore cluster sizes for this study. 
Methods could, however, be extended to accomodate group sizes larger than one. 
This may be done by considering counts of individuals (rather than detections) in the count model described below or by including a model for cluster sizes. 
The latter may be desirable e.g. if group size data are overdispersed _CITE_.
Recall that _MATH_ is the number of edges of weight _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
By transitivity of the action of the Weyl group of _MATH_ on _MATH_ the number of edges of weight _MATH_ incident to every vertex _MATH_ is the same and is easily seen to be _MATH_ when _MATH_. 
Summing over all exceptional classes we see that _MATHDISP_. 
From this identity together with Lemma _REF_ part _MATH_ applied with _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_ and the last equality follows from Lemma _REF_. 
_MATH_ 
From Lemma _REF_ we know _MATH_. 
As a result by Lemma _REF_ part _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_ where the last equality follows from Lemma _REF_. 
_MATH_ Optimality follows from weak duality. 
_MATH_ 
The claim follows from Lemma _REF_ part _MATH_ and the above expression for _MATH_. 
Finally we show that the essential performance ratio of the graphs _MATH_ is equal to one. 
To this end we need the following combinatorial Lemma,
First, solutions to the leaderless/leader-follower attitude synchronization and the cooperative attitude tracking problems are derived in the full state information case and in the presence of bounded time-varying communication delays. 
By exploiting the properties of the attitude dynamics and the unit-quaternion, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are used to derive sufficient conditions on the communication delays and the controller gains such that the control objective is attained under a fixed and undirected communication topology.
We observe that in the special case when the solvency level is given by _REF_, all quantities are given by the market except for _MATH_ and _MATH_ which may be chosen by a supervisory authority. 
In other words, the authority fixes the liquidity _MATH_ needed to start a pension fund and the percentage _MATH_ of the accrued contribution that must be stored to regulate wisely the pension fund. 
This choice should always satisfy _REF_ and may vary depending on the goals of the authority itself. 
For example, a high value of _MATH_ will force the fund manager to adopt more prudential behavior in order to avoid default, but would restrict her/his investment strategies and the value would be smaller (see Remark _REF_). 
Also a high _MATH_ would decrease the number of new entries in the market, and so on (see also Remark _REF_).
_CITE_ 
A function _MATH_ is said to be uniformly continuous on _MATH_ if _MATHDISP_.
Integrating (_REF_) yields the general solution _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are integration constants to be determined by using (_REF_). 
It turns out that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Thus, the solution takes the form _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the standard error and complementary error functions, respectively. 
The solution (_REF_) is identical with the known solution (_REF_) which can be obtained by other methods. 
The present method of solution seems to be simple and powerful and, hence, could be used for other partial differential equations.
The goal of this section is to prove Proposition _REF_ which is a precise version of Table _REF_ and (_REF_). 
Throughout this section and below, the stochastic dynamics of a variant with scaled population size exceeding _MATH_ will be replaced by corresponding deterministic dynamics. 
More precisely, during _MATH_ all variants _MATH_ with _MATH_ will be taken to evolve deterministically and _MATH_ will be taken to evolve deterministically on _MATH_ where _MATH_ will be defined below.
Due to a small heat capacity of the electron gas, thermalization caused by electron-electron interactions _CITE_ takes place during a time scale less than few hundred femtoseconds. 
This time is relatively small referring to the total duration of the surface temperature response which takes more than 10 ps. 
Thus, the heating of the electron gas is assumed to be instantaneous and, applying Cattaneo's law to the phonon subsystem of TTM allows one to transform the model into the hyperbolic heat equation _CITE_. 
The developed model taking into account the both sources, i.e. volumetric as well as the surface heat flux, is studied analytically within a semi-infinite domain and agrees well with the experimental data. 
This model allows us to define the time of electron-phonon relaxation as the ratio of the penetration depth to the speed of sound in the bulk material. 
Since the dependence of the penetration depth on the wavelength has been experimentally observed, for instance in _CITE_, the definition of the electron-phonon relaxation time has a physical meaning and provides an explanation of experimental results which show dependence of the electron-phonon relaxation time on the wavelength.
Elevated temperature creep of pearlitic steels: an experimental-numerical approach
In this paper, we have presented a novel terrain rendering algorithm based on quasi Delaunay triangulation (DT). 
The proposed algorithm uses an off-line process to compute a relative rank for each sampling point in a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). 
It then dynamically constructs a mesh model from a set of points selected according to their viewpoint distances and relative ranks. 
The mesh model is initialized to be a genuine DT. 
As the viewpoint moves, the mesh is dynamically maintained. 
We use simple methods for point insertion and removal and then eliminate the slivery triangles gradually by collecting and flipping illegal edges incident to them. 
We have designed a queueing system to manage the numerous operations and amortize the burst computations to successive frames. 
The proposed algorithm produces a concise and well-composed mesh adaptive to both viewpoint and the terrain's local geometry. 
Most importantly, it supports smooth morphing without imposing any constraints on the LOD control. 
Algorithms with such properties have not yet appeared in the literature. 
We validated our algorithm by experiments. 
The proposed quasi DT based approach can be extended to render other objects and be applied to other fields besides computer graphics that need DT and smooth morphing.
Note that, the mapping _MATH_ is called a _MATH_-mapping generated by _MATH_ and _MATH_.
An optical amplifier introduces broadband amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE noise). 
This is in fact the dominant impairment affecting channel performance and OSNR, i.e., accumulation of ASE noise in amplifiers. 
The reason is that typically dispersion and nonlinearity effects are considered to be limited (see _CITE_, _CITE_). 
ASE noise generated by an optical amplifier is gain dependent which means that it is wavelength-dependent also, due to the spectral gain shape of the amplifier.
All eigenvalues of _MATH_ must be real, i.e. _MATH_.
The constant steady state amplitude and phase, _MATH_ and _MATH_, are determined by solving for the zeros of these equations, which satisfy, _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Using _MATH_ the steady state phase can be eliminated from Eqns. (_REF_) and (_REF_), resulting in the following relationship between the amplitude of the fluctuating torque _MATH_ and the steady-state absorber amplitude, _MATHDISP_. 
Once _MATH_ is obtained from this expresssion, Eqns. (_REF_) and (_REF_) can be used to recover the corresponding phase _MATH_. 
In all subsequent discussions, results generated from Eqns. (_REF_) and (_REF_) will be referred to as theory.
In conclusion, our numerical simulations clearly demonstrate that small-amplitude initial pulses in vertical velocity and gas pressure are able to trigger a plethora of dynamic phenomena in the upper regions of the solar atmosphere with periods in the range _MATH_ seconds, a value which depends on orientation of the background magnetic-field. 
However, it should be noted that the 2D simulations performed are idealized in the sense that they do not include radiative transfer and thermal conduction along field lines. 
The magnetic-field configuration and the equilibrium stratification are simple and we modeled a single granule only. 
These limitations require additional studies which we intend to carry out in the near future.
In our study of the semimartingale spaces with respect to _MATH_ and its enlargements, the notion of a compensator of _MATH_ will turn out to be of crucial importance. 
For the convenience of the reader we next recall its definition. 
Let _MATH_ be a filtration containing _MATH_. 
We denote by _MATH_ the predictable _MATH_-field on _MATH_ associated with _MATH_, and, for any _MATH_, by _MATH_ its restriction to _MATH_. 
Then, there exists a unique (up to a _MATH_-null set) predictable random measure _MATH_, called the compensator of _MATH_ relative to _MATH_, which satisfies the following condition _MATHDISP_ for every nonnegative _MATH_-measurable function _MATH_. 
It is straightforward to show that the compensator of _MATH_ with respect to the filtration _MATH_ is the deterministic measure _MATHDISP_. 
In the following we will often use the abbreviation _MATH_ for the _MATH_-compensated measure. 
Moreover, we will use the following notation. 
Let _MATH_ be a random measure. 
Then we denote by _MATH_ the measure on _MATH_ defined by _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, given a measurable process _MATH_, we will sometimes write _MATH_, if the integral is defined either in the Lebesgue or stochastic sense.
In the mass range considered in this study and using Equation (_REF_), we have _MATH_, with _MATH_, for typical values of the ambient solar-wind density _MATH_, and impact speed _MATH_ _CITE_, which is close to the solar wind velocity because of the pick-up-ion-like mechanism. 
For STEREO-A, the effective sensitive area is _MATH_ _CITE_. 
The mass for which _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
This mass is of the same order of magnitude of the maximum dust mass detected, _MATH_kg, corresponding to the mass range measured by TDS _CITE_.
As stated above, the dependence of the decameter spike duration on the frequency is very close to that for collision times. 
Furthermore the spike duration practically does not depend on the location of the active region. 
This indicates that the duration at these frequencies is defined by processes in the place of generation and not by effects of radio-emission propagation. 
Our point of view is that the spike duration is governed by particle collisions. 
If correct, then the temperature of the plasma at different heights can be determined by measuring the durations of spikes at the corresponding frequencies. 
The temperature is approximately equal to _MATH_K for 27 July to 2 August, _MATH_.
(1). Assume that there exists a control function _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ hold for all _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a positive constant depending only on _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_.
The factor _MATH_ in Theorem 3.1 in _CITE_ and the factor _MATH_ in (_REF_) suggest that each _MATH_ will involve a factor _MATH_. 
Theorem 4.1 in _CITE_ suggest that each _MATH_ will involve a linear combination of _MATH_ and a further variable which appears in Theorem _REF_. 
Finally, we find each _MATH_ in Theorem _REF_ by comparing the coefficients of power series of _MATH_ in the expansions of the appropriate quantities.
Type 3 dictionaries allow to exploit an explicit mask, i.e. to specify an area of the image to be masked (in such a case it is not required that the image and the mask have the same resolution, but they must have the same position in the page). 
It uses two more sub-dictionaries, the image data dictionary (DataDict) and the mask dictionary (MaskDict), that are similar to a Type 1 dictionary, except for some restrictions applied to the parameters. 
The parameters for Type 1 dictionaries are reported in Table _REF_, while those for Type 3 dictionaries can be found in Table _REF_.
The cargo vain contains 3 LD3 containers abreast per section for a total of 51 containers, corresponding to 0.065 m_MATH_ per passenger. 
As shown in Fig. _REF_, the fuselage webs are connected by three decks horizontally and two trusses vertically; the trusses, connecting top and bottom fuselage, are designed against pressurization to save much weight under internal pressure. 
The two passenger decks are also connected each other vertically, and both them to the bottom fuselage, by means of supports in order to reduce the empty weight of the two decks. 
In this way, the fuselage is divided into two lateral compartments and an internal one. 
In the areas in front of the exits some vertical trusses are missing and some structural problems could arise; they are solved by means of a proper structural design of the upper keel beams.
In This section we will shortly introduce some additional RDB concepts that are used in E.F. Codd's relational algebra for RDBs _CITE_.
The second half of this section discusses some advanced measurement techniques. 
Section _REF_ considers the use of optical fibre for RF measurements to mitigate the negative influence of conventional cables. 
In Section _REF_, a spheroidal coupler is used for antenna measurements, which provides a compact, low-cost TRP measurement system with high sensitivity and speed. 
Section _REF_ introduces a 3-D radiation pattern measurement system for _MATH_ GHz antennas.
Let _MATH_ be the curve _MATH_ over the field _MATH_ given by the polynomial _MATH_. 
Let us represent the elements of _MATH_ in hexadecimal form. 
Consider the point _MATH_0x10F,0x27A) whose order is _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_0x1FB,0x2C6_MATH_. 
We can use Algorithm _REF_ to obtain _MATH_ as follows:
Image components play a very important role in many kinds of documents, because they leverage on the human perception capabilities to compactly and immediately represent large amounts of information that even long textual descriptions could not satisfactorily express. 
While text is a type of linear and discrete information, however, visual information is inherently multi-dimensional (2D still images, that will be the area of interest of this book, are characterized along three dimensions: two refer to space and one to color) and continuous. 
Thus, while the transposition of the former into a computer representation is straightforward, being both characterized by the same features, the translation of the latter posed severe problems, and rose the need for formats that could find a good trade-off among the amount of information to be preserved, the memory space demand and the manipulation processes to be supported. 
To make the whole thing even more difficult, all these requirements may have different relevance depending on the aims for which the image is produced.
As for the electron in an electric field, we start by giving the zeroth order diagonalization matrix as well as the effective energy _MATH_. 
Since at that order, _MATH_ can be thought as commuting variables, one finds easily that the Hamiltonian diagonalization is performed through the following Foldy-Wouthuysen unitary matrix: _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ 
We also need the Berry phases at the lowest order: _MATHDISP_ 
The matrix _MATH_ Eq. (_REF_) needed to obtain the corrections to the energy at the second order is even simpler than for the electron in an electric field since here (see Eq. _MATH_): _MATHDISP_ Therefore Berry connections and covariant variables to the second order reduce to _MATH_ and _MATH_ as well as _MATH_, _MATH_.
Now, we offer some criteria for certain asymptotic behavior of all nonoscillatory solutions. 
For our further references we set _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_.
Blandford et al. (1986) assume that the scattering density distribution of the extended medium is Gaussian; we assume, however, that the total scattering strength density distribution of the two-component interstellar medium is the sum of a thin-screen and extended medium, namely: _MATHDISP_, where the subscripts 's' and 'm' represent the thin screen medium and the extended medium, respectively. 
The scattering strength of the thin screen medium is presented by a _MATH_ function distribution, while the scattering density of the extended medium is consistent with a Gaussian distribution. 
_MATH_ and _MATH_ are the total scattering strength of the thin screen and extended medium, respectively, _MATH_ is the _MATH_ width of the distribution, _MATH_ is the distance to the observer, and _MATH_ is the distance from the pulsar to the thin screen. 
Apparently from Fig. 1, _MATH_ and _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the distance of the source. 
Similar to the adopted figure in other authors' work (Qian &amp; Zhang 1996), there are two free distance parameters used here, _MATH_ and _MATH_, going in opposite directions for their convenience in the following mathematical description and derivation of equations.
In general an arithmetic subgroup of _MATH_ is any discrete subgroup _MATH_ that is commensurable with _MATH_, where commensurability means that the intersection _MATH_ is of finite index in both _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The group _MATH_ has the property of being commensurable with _MATH_.
Figure _REF_ shows the flow of a package of information between 2 points through the 7-layers protocol stack.
The neural correlates of working memory (WM) in schizophrenia (SZ) have been extensively studied using the multi-site fMRI data acquired by the Functional Biomedical Informatics Research Network (fBIRN) consortium. 
Although univariate and multivariate analysis methods have been variously employed to localize brain responses under differing task conditions, important hypotheses regarding the representation of mental processes in the spatio-temporal patterns of neural recruitment and the differential organization of these mental processes in patients versus controls have not been addressed in this context. 
This paper uses a multivariate state-space model (SSM) to analyze the differential representation and organization of mental processes of controls and patients performing the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm (SIRP) WM task. 
The SSM is able to not only predict the mental state of the subject from the data, but also yield estimates of the spatial distribution and temporal ordering of neural activity, along with estimates of the hemodynamic response. 
The dynamical Bayesian modeling approach used in this study was able to find significant differences between the predictability and organization of the working memory processes of SZ patients versus healthy subjects. 
Prediction of some stimulus types from imaging data in the SZ group was significantly lower than controls, reflecting a greater level of disorganization/heterogeneity of their mental processes. 
Moreover, the changes in accuracy of predicting the mental state of the subject with respect to parametric modulations, such as memory load and task duration, may have important implications on the neuro-cognitive models for WM processes in both SZ and healthy adults. 
Additionally, the SSM was used to compare the spatio-temporal patterns of mental activity across subjects, in a holistic fashion and to derive a low-dimensional representation space for the SIRP task, in which subjects were found to cluster according to their diagnosis.
From the conditions (_REF_) and (_REF_) in Theorems 1 and 2, one can find that the impulsive interval _MATH_ and the impulsive gain matrix _MATH_ have nothing to do with the constant _MATH_ in Assumption 1. 
That is to say, the constant _MATH_ need not be known beforehand and the impulsive synchronization can be achieved only if the complex-variable nonlinear system satisfy Assumption 1. 
To certain extent, the proposed method is universal and effective.
Some CME parameters follow the solar cycle rather well while others do not _CITE_. 
The number of CMEs per day shows a strong dependence on the solar cycle (_CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_; _CITE_, _CITE_). 
The CME speeds have also been found to follow the solar cycle _CITE_. 
However, the CME mass and angular width do not exhibit a significant variation with the solar cycle _CITE_. 
The number of CMEs was shown to follow well the sunspot number only during the rising phase of Solar Cycle 23, while there were large fluctuations in the maximum and the declining phase of this solar cycle _CITE_. 
The CME sources associated with active regions follow the butterfly diagram and appear at lower latitudes as the cycle progresses, while those related to filaments outside active regions tend to migrate towards higher latitudes _CITE_.
North-South asymmetry and imbalance of positive and negative magnetic fluxes represent different, yet closely connected, features of the photospheric magnetic field. 
North-South asymmetry (as defined by Equation (_REF_)) is the difference of the total fluxes of the two solar hemispheres. 
In contrast, the imbalance of positive and negative magnetic fluxes represents the net flux of both hemispheres (Equation (_REF_)).
We have given a detailed justification of the three coupled-mode equations which describe gap solitons bifurcating in the first band gap of a two-dimensional separable periodic potential. 
These equations are generic (structurally stable) for the considered bifurcation but they can be modified for other relevant bifurcation problems. 
We review here several examples of other bifurcations, where the justification analysis is expected to be applicable in a similar manner.
By induction, using _REF_, it is easy to see that the sequence _MATH_ is nondecreasing and _MATH_. 
Thus the sequence _MATH_ converges to _MATH_. 
By Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem and letting _MATH_ in _REF_, we get _MATHDISP_, which in view of _MATH_ implies _MATHDISP_, eventually, let us say _MATH_. 
Therefore, _MATHDISP_. 
An integration from _MATH_ to _MATH_, yields _MATHDISP_. 
Letting _MATH_, we obtain a contradiction. 
The proof is complete.
The recent discovery in the initial state radiation at _MATH_-factories of the _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ indicates an overpopulation of the expected charmonium _MATH_- states _CITE_. 
Maini et al. _CITE_ argue that _MATH_ is the _MATH_- _MATH_ state of the charm-strange diquark-antidiquark tetraquark. 
We find that _MATH_ cannot be interpreted in this way, since the mass of such _MATH_ tetraquark is found to be _MATH_ MeV higher. 
A more natural tetraquark interpretation could be the _MATH_- _MATH_ state _MATH_ (_MATH_) which mass is predicted in our model to be close to the mass of _MATH_ (see Table _REF_). 
Then the _MATH_ would decay dominantly into _MATH_ pairs. 
The other possible interpretations of _MATH_ are the _MATH_- _MATH_ states of _MATH_ and _MATH_ tetraquarks which predicted masses have close values. 
These additional tetraquark states could be responsible for the mass difference of _MATH_ observed in different decay channels. 
As we see from Table _REF_, the recently discovered resonances _MATH_ and _MATH_ in the _MATH_ cross section can be interpreted as the excited _MATH_- _MATH_ (_MATH_) and _MATH_ (_MATH_) tetraquark states, respectively. 
The peak _MATH_ very recently observed by Belle in _MATH_ _CITE_ is consistent with a _MATH_- resonance _MATH_ and therefore has the same interpretation in our model.
Aside from the dynamical system _REF_, further kinematic conditions on _MATH_ and _MATH_ are satisfied, which give _MATHDISP_. 
Here, _MATH_ is the solution to the Cauchy problem: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
This expresses the fact that the interface _MATH_ and the free boundary _MATH_ consist of the same particles for all _MATH_, which do not leave them and are not incident from _MATH_. 
In particular, we exclude the mass transpotation through the interface _MATH_, because we assume that the two fluids are immiscible.
By the lemma (_REF_), zero solution for the system (_REF_) can undergo a local bifurcation when _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be the bifurcation parameter, we rewrite the system (_REF_) as _MATHDISP_ 
The linearization of the system (_REF_) at origin is _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
The system (_REF_) has the transcritical bifurcation if _MATHDISP_ and the pitchfork bifurcation if _MATHDISP_. 
Obviously, the linear system (_REF_) has eigenvalues _MATH_, which one of them is corresponding to the equation _MATH_ in this system. 
We compute eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues for the linear system (_REF_). 
Therefore, bases for the center subspace of the system (_REF_) and its transpose are _MATHDISP_. 
By using the following bilinear form _MATHDISP_ we have _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_ and _MATH_. 
Now, we consider the local coordinates _MATH_ on the center manifold. 
By using the subsection 2.1, the nonlinear terms in the system (_REF_) and the matrix _MATH_ can be written as follows _MATHDISP_.
Figure _REF_ depicts how the variable sumvalue approaches _MATH_ and the error is reduced to zero as the number of terms increases. 
In other words, sumvalue converges to _MATH_, whereas the error converges to zero.
The ROI analysed in detail in this work are located in three of the above-mentioned patches. 
Black boxes e1, e2, and e3 in Figure _REF_ denote the location of these ROI. 
Events e1 and e2 are quite far from major sunspots or stable magnetic entities, whereas e3 is surrounded by some dark pores with developing penumbrae. 
Nevertheless, in all three cases the NFI Stokes _MATH_ images reveal intense magnetic activity all around the weak circular-polarization patches where the events are located. 
Event e1 takes place in an area of dominantly positive pre-existing field, e3 in negative-field environment, while e2 over the magnetic inversion line of the emerging AR.
The acceptance-and-efficiency corrected transverse mass distributions are shown in the left panel of Fig. _REF_ for the different collision centralities, normalized in absolute terms.
Tabu Search (TS) is a meta-heuristic method in which a fundamental role is played by keeping track of features of previously visited solutions _CITE_. 
The basic mechanism of Tabu Search is quite simple: at each iteration a subset of the neighborhood of the current solution is explored and the neighbor that gives the minimum value of the cost function becomes the new current solution independently of the fact that its value is better or worse than the current solution.
Let _MATH_ be a finitely-generated inner product space and let _MATH_ be a list of vectors in _MATH_. 
The Gram matrix of this is list is the _MATH_ matrix _MATH_ defined by _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be a basis for _MATH_. 
Given vectors _MATH_ and _MATH_ in _MATH_, we note that _MATH_,where _MATH_ is the Gram matrix of _MATH_.
Now assume that there exists a cusp _MATH_ with _MATH_ such that for any non-negative integer _MATH_, there exists an integer _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
By Theorem _REF_, _MATHDISP_. 
So for any non-negative integer _MATH_ there exists an integer _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Therefore _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATH_ is not supercuspidal.
Locally, the stress state is described by the polar parameters _MATH_ and _MATH_ and characterized by the parameter _MATH_. 
The optimal values of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are described by three types of solutions with increasing values of _MATH_: Case 1 (Free lamination sequence): for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, such that _MATHDISP_.
Gesture: Elementary movement of the human body part defines the gesture. 
This action is performed in very short span of time and its complexity remain low. 
Waving a hand, stretching an arms and bending are used to define the meaning of full motion of the person.
The main object of our consideration in this section is the sequence of the sets of admissible solutions _MATHDISP_ to the original problem _MATH_. 
Our aim is to study its _MATH_-limiting properties in the sense of Definition _REF_. 
In spite of the fact that we have no result concerning _MATH_-compactness of the sequences of sets in the scale _MATH_, we will show that the _MATH_-limit set exists for the sequence _REF_ and it can be recovered in an implicit analytical form. 
As it follows from the Definition _REF_, the main difficulty is connected with the passage to the limit in integral identity (_REF_) for problem (_REF_) as _MATH_.
A 1D Poincare return mapping for the slow _MATH_-variable can be defined on a 2D cross-section that cuts transversely the spiking manifold _MATH_ in a line _MATH_. 
On it, the mapping defined over periods _MATH_ of revolutions around the 2D cylinder shaped manifold _MATH_ assumes the form _CITE_: _MATHDISP_. 
In essence, Eq. (_REF_) is a discrete version of the averaged equation (_REF_). 
Properties of (_REF_) are determined by the product _MATH_, scaled with _MATH_, provided that the mapping is not considered near the homoclinic saddle-node bifurcation (SNIC) where the revolution period around _MATH_ grows with no bound. 
Indeed, it is _MATH_ that dictates the dynamics of the mapping.
Fix _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then there exists a _MATH_ such that for all _MATH_ and every _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_.
(2) For any sequence of constants _MATH_ satisfying (_REF_) and _MATH_ the CLT in (_REF_) holds.
Two models have been presented which show how a boundary condition modeling the single-occupancy constraint can be constructed for diffusion equations from sequences of random walks. 
In the Interval Model, the diffusion equation on an interval, Eq. _REF_, is coupled with an equation describing the time evolution of the occupancy of the binding site, Eq. _REF_ through the boundary condition, Eq. _REF_. 
The system is not closed because of its dependence on the joint expectation _MATH_. 
For the case of _MATH_, a simple analysis shows that, in the limit _MATH_, the joint expectation can be expressed in terms of _MATH_ and _MATH_ through Particle Number Dependence, Eq. _REF_. 
For _MATH_, the same result can be obtained as an approximation. 
When Particle Number Dependence holds, _MATH_, occupation of sites 1 and _MATH_ is anti-correlated. 
The anti-correlation arises from the fixed no. of particles in the Interval Model. 
Further, in the limit _MATH_, our analysis shows that the Interval Model is described by a system of two coupled first order ODEs, Eqs. _REF_ and _REF_. 
The limit _MATH_ corresponds to infinitesimal values of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Remarkably, numerical simulations suggest that this system of two coupled ODEs approximates the solution of the Interval Model accurately when only _MATH_. 
The rates _MATH_ and _MATH_ may be _MATH_.
The coefficient _MATH_ solves the homological equation, and is well defined precisely when _MATH_ is invertible. 
But _MATH_ is characteristic matrix _MATH_ of _MATH_, and this is invertible precisely when _MATH_ is not an eigenvalue of _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_, and the remaining eigenvalues _MATH_ are assumed to have norm greater than one, we have that _MATH_ is not an eigenvalue as long as _MATH_. 
But these are exactly the _MATH_ for which we want to solve the equation, as the constant and first order terms are already constrained. 
Then the series solution _MATH_ is formally well defined to all orders.
Define stopping times _MATH_. 
The stopped process _MATH_ has bounded jump rates, and therefore standard theory tells us that for each _MATH_ and _MATH_, the process _MATHDISP_ is a martingale. 
Moreover, it easily follows from (_REF_) that _MATHDISP_, which in turn implies that _MATH_ as _MATH_, and hence _MATH_. 
Using the fact that _MATH_ maps _MATH_ into itself and (_REF_) for some sufficiently high _MATH_ (depending on _MATH_), one can show that for fixed _MATH_, the random variables _MATH_ are uniformly integrable. 
Therefore, letting _MATH_ in (_REF_), one finds that the process in (_REF_) is a martingale. 
Letting _MATH_ in (_REF_) yields (_REF_).
For the future, we plan to work on various directions. 
First of all, we plan to study the relationship between the structure of the instance and the parameter values. 
This research, which is already ongoing, implies the identification and the analysis of a large number of potential features and the study of their correlation to the parameter values.
Hence, if a psychological test is conceived as a distribution of responses with several possible outcomes that are constrained by means of requirements on latents traits and item characteristics, the probability of a correct response can be derived. 
The method is applied with the two-fold purpose of analyzing an alternative way of deriving the logistic IRT models and of exploring if such a derivation helps improve the understanding of their measurement properties. 
Whether psychological attributes should be considered qualitative rather than quantitative has been indeed argued _CITE_. 
Confirmation of a quantitative scale can be done using additive or polynomial conjoint measurement _CITE_. 
Necessary and sufficient conditions for additivity in finite structures have been given in the form of a denumerable set of independence or cancellation conditions _CITE_. 
Conditions for conjoint attributes whose components are a mixture of finite and infinite systems have also been given _CITE_. 
Similarities and differences between RM and the theory of fundamental measurement have been recently debated _CITE_. 
Mistaking, however, a qualitative attribute for a quantitative one has been defined as "the psychometricians' fallacy" _CITE_. 
Indeed, the total number of possible ordered relations of a conjoint attribute is not exhausted by the strict order of its components _CITE_. 
Higher-order cancellation conditions must be satisfied to ensure a quantitative nature _CITE_.
1) Horizontal magnetic flux tubes are below the visible photospheric level. 
Large loops connecting opposite magnetic polarities are observed in the FOV and others extend beyond and reach higher atmospheric layers. 
Multiple scales of magnetic field concentrations are associated with the emerging flux region and both magnetic polarities can be found in all parts of the active region with an intricate fine structure which is also highly dynamic. 
This is a common phenomena for an emerging active region that shows a high degree of fragmentation, as pointed out by _CITE_, _CITE_, _CITE_.
For the repulsive case with its homogeneous ground-state density _MATH_, such a linear response to an external inhomogeneous potential can be computed rather easily, taking advantage of Fourier decomposition; for applications to disordered potentials see, e.g., the work of Giorgini et al. _CITE_ and Sanchez-Palencia _CITE_. 
For a soliton with its inhomogeneous ground state density, a very similar linear response scheme, technically slightly more demanding but perhaps also more interesting, is presented in the following.
In the parametric case, restricting the mean and variance of _MATH_ is straightforward, as we can simply let _MATH_ correspond to the standard normal distribution. 
However, if we let _MATH_ be unknown through using a DP or DPM prior, such constraints are not incorporated. 
One strategy is to choose the base distribution to be constrained. 
For example, one could let _MATH_, with _MATH_ chosen to correspond to the standard normal distribution. 
In this case, the prior expectation of the mean of _MATH_ is zero and the prior expectation of the variance of _MATH_ is one. 
However, the posterior expectations of the mean and variance of _MATH_ can deviate substantially from these prior expectations, leading to substantially biased inferences.
The approach proposed by Balsamo and Marzolla in _CITE_ generates a process-oriented discrete-event simulation model of software system at a high level of abstraction. 
The considered software model is a UML software specification describing the software architecture of the system. 
The used UML 1.x diagrams are use case, activity and deployment diagrams. 
The diagrams are annotated according to a sub-set of the UML SPT profile. 
Such annotations are used to parameterize the simulation model: the workload offered to the system, the resource consumption associated to each processing steps, the characteristics of each resources. 
The approach defines an (almost) one-to-one correspondence between the entities expressed in the UML model and the entities or processes in the simulation model. 
Thus, the obtained simulation model has the same structure of the software model. 
This correspondence allows easy visualization of the performance results back to the software specification. 
The approach implements this visualization by using suitably tag values of the SPT stereotypes. 
For instance, if the simulation reports that the utilization of a processing node (that is a deployment node annotated with &lt;&lt;PAhost&gt;&gt; stereotype) is _MATH_, UML-_MATH_ is able to insert in the &lt;&lt;PAhost&gt;&gt; stereotype the PAutilizzation tag value containing the calculated value, that is _MATH_.
Below, we consider f(G) gravity with curvature-matter coupling, which is here called the modified f(G) gravity. 
The Lagrangian density of matter only appears in coupling term and the action is given by _MATHDISP_, where we have chosen _MATH_, which will be adopted hereafter. 
Varying the action (_REF_) with respect to the metric _MATH_ yields the field equations: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, and _MATH_ is the energy-momentum tensor of matter, which is defined as: _MATHDISP_.
The methods are summarized in_REF_ and a selection of the proper detection scheme can be made according to the bandwidth limitations of the system. 
One may ask what a fourth entry to the table might be (i.e., low receiver bandwidth but high transmitter bandwidth). 
It is a non-sinewave single-harmonic WMS (e.g. Ref. _CITE_). 
Since this realizes a very non-uniform emission frequency scanning coverage, the noise performance is not necessarily like direct spectroscopy with its uniform scanning and depends on the system model.
The complete picture is revealed when we scan the modulation frequency over a wide range. 
At low frequencies (200-600 MHz) the diode is susceptible to modulation. 
As we increase the modulation frequency the sidebands decay. 
The modulation index is suddenly increased again when the modulation frequency is around the value of half the FSR. 
This is shown in Fig. _REF_. 
It is important to mention that at this point only the second optical sidebands are observed. 
The first sidebands are suppressed since they do not overlap the cavity modes. 
The modulation index at this point is lower relative to the full FSR case, indicating that the carrier is not fully suppressed. 
Scanning further, the modulation response decays, only to revive again when the modulation frequency matches the FSR. 
At this point sidebands from both odd and even orders will appear as they are all supported by the cavity modes.
Syntax. 
Let _MATH_ be an _MATH_ relation and _MATH_ be the language associated with _MATH_. 
A (non-interactive) adaptive instance dependent commitment scheme (AIDCS) for _MATH_ is a tuple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms (Com, Com', Adapt), where: _MATH_ is the bit commitment algorithm: 
For a bit _MATH_, an instance _MATH_ and a random string _MATH_ (where _MATH_ is a polynomial), _MATH_ returns a commitment value _MATH_.
We would like to mention that the above test system (_REF_) satisfies Assumptions _REF_ and _REF_ for the desired trajectories _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Therefore, the optimal tracking control scheme developed above can be used to design optimal controller for this plant.
Subexponential growth implies amenabilty, but the converse is not true: as already mentioned, the lamplighter group is an amenable group with exponential growth. 
See _CITE_ for general facts about amenability and subexponential growth, and _CITE_ for a nice exposition of the lamplighter group.
The last two columns of Table _REF_ show the results using the full set of covariates. 
Unemployment time after the last obtained interview is no longer statistically significant, as none of the other spell covariates. 
The estimates of age, education and residential area remain roughly the same as in the previous model. 
Persons with household disposable income in the second, third or fourth quartile are less likely to attrite compared to persons in the first quartile. 
Persons with highest household income levels are not likely to participate at all in the survey, which means that respondents at wave 1 are already a selected sample with respect to level of income.
A mutation for a binary coded chromosome always simply changes 0 to 1 or vice versa. 
However, for a CSD structure, the mutation will destruct the CSD format. 
In this chapter, we introduce a method for the mutation so that the CSD format will be maintained after mutation.
We carry out the operator product expansion to the vacuum condensates adding up to dimension-10 and take the assumption of vacuum saturation for the high dimension vacuum condensates, they are always factorized to lower condensates with vacuum saturation in the QCD sum rules, and factorization works well in large _MATH_ limit. 
In calculation, we observe that the contributions from the gluon condensate are suppressed by large denominators and would not play any significant roles _CITE_.
The basic scenario of these transients is as follows: electron (or proton) beams injected into a flux tube are rather dense and intense, thus, inducing an electric field equal to their total charge (Zharkova and Gordovskyy, 2006). 
At the same time they are gyrating about the flux tube magnetic field and, as a result of their gyration, they, in turn, induce their own magnetic field that can have either the same polarity as the flux-tube field or opposite to it (depending on a sign of the tube field and the particle charge). 
The conclusions of Hudson, Fisher and Welsh (2007) agree with those by Zharkova and Zharkov (2007) that during their precipitation into a flaring atmosphere the high-energy particles carry sufficient energy to account for the observed seismic signatures.
As noted in Example _REF_, classically there is no difference in the computational complexity of determining satisfiability of classes of propositional formulas no matter what their form (3CNF, CNF, or polynomial sized). 
However, parameterized reductions tend to be much more structure preserving than classical reductions, and certainly most classical reductions, such as the reduction between CNF Satisfiability and 3SAT, are definitely not parameterized reductions. 
In fact we believe that there is no parameterized reduction between Weighted 3SAT and Weighted CNF Satisfiability. 
We offer some evidence for this claim in the next chapter. 
It seems to us that the situation is the following. 
Classical reductions are so coarse that the vast majority of natural problems in NP that are apparently not in P are precisely NP-complete. 
Remarkably, in parameterized complexity, something similar occurs, in that almost all natural parameterized problems belong to about about five complexity-equivalent classes, most prominently, the first three classes of the _MATH_-hierarchy.
The emerging high-frequency picture is clearly complex, with rich flows of information describing partly or completely the microscopic interactions between the market participants. 
Yet, our particular needs about this information are limited as we would like to obtain only the equivalent of a single "prevailing" price for each time. 
The simple solution is to use the best bid and ask prices, and then to compute the logarithmic middle price. 
But the prices occur at random times, with a finite granularity (i.e. the prices are quoted with a conventional accuracy, for example of 0.01$). 
Therefore, there is no convergence to a continuous path. 
Because of this lack of convergence, the basic diffusion model for the price evolution needs to be revisited for very short time intervals, with important consequences for the volatility.
The variables _MATH_ and _MATH_ represent the complex in-determinants in the discrete Laplace Transform and are related to the Fourier domain frequency terms _MATH_ and _MATH_ by the relationship _MATH_ and _MATH_ (where _MATH_).
Throughout this section we assume that _MATH_, that _MATH_, that _MATH_ have _MATH_ continuous derivative s, and that _MATHDISP_. 
This condition is satisfied by our standard examples: _MATH_ for _MATH_, and by various combinations thereof. 
To be specific, we assume that _MATH_. 
Let _MATHDISP_. 
For a given positive integer _MATH_ we seek to represent the solution of _REF_, _REF_ as _MATHDISP_, etc. _MATH_ is the asymptotic expansion, _MATH_ is the regular expansion, _MATH_ is the initial-layer expansion, and _MATH_ is the error. 
We adopt the convention that in speaking of function s indexed with subscript _MATH_, the word all refers only to _MATH_.
By using contour integration method, prove that if _MATH_ is a rational part of _MATH_, i.e. _MATH_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ and numbers _MATH_ and _MATH_ are positive integers such that _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_ Nota Bene: a particular case of formula a) for _MATH_ was already derived by Malmsten et al. _CITE_. 
He separetely treated cases _MATH_ odd and _MATH_ even and simplified the result in both cases (simplification is not the same, see e.g. exercise n¬∞_REF_ where we also treat separetely these two cases and performed such a simplification). 
Other formul√¶ obtained above seem to be never released before.
Let _MATH_ be such, that for any _MATH_. 
Assume that there exists _MATH_, such that for any _MATH_, _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
Assume additionally, that for any _MATH_, the level curve _MATH_ has its Lebesgue measure 0. 
Then _MATHDISP_.
Classify the patterns at decimal valued patterns, by means of table look up matrix.
In 2010, Wang et al. [7] considered second-order boundary value problem with the integral boundary conditions _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are continuous, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are nonnegative constants. 
The existence result was obtained by applying the method of upper and lower solutions and Leray-Schauder degree theory. 
Theorem 1 (see [7]) supposed that the upper and lower solutions exist, and then, using the theory of differential inequalities to prove that there is a solution to the boundary value problem between the upper and lower solutions.
Definition _REF_ associates to each equivalence class of phirotopes _MATH_ a set of phased sets satisfying the two conditions listed in the theorem, and Section _REF_ shows that this collection satisfies the circuit axioms.
Let _MATH_ be the restriction of _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is a pin-line-generic pin-collinear body-and-pin realization of _MATH_ so, again by the minimality of _MATH_ and Lemma _REF_, _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is a 0-extension of _MATH_, Lemma _REF_ implies that _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is a subframework of _MATH_, we may use (_REF_) to deduce that _MATHDISP_ for some _MATH_. 
By symmetry we may assume that _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_. 
By Lemma _REF_, _MATH_ does not decrease if we move _MATH_ in a small enough neighbourhood to a new position _MATH_, in such a way that it remains on _MATH_, but no longer lies on _MATH_, and such that the line _MATH_ through _MATH_ and _MATH_ intersects _MATH_ at a point _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Choose a point _MATH_ such that _MATH_ are not collinear. 
Define _MATH_ by putting _MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is a pin-collinear body-and-pin realization of _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ can be obtained from _MATH_ by first relabelling _MATH_ as _MATH_, then performing a 1-extension (deleting _MATH_ and adding _MATH_ for some _MATH_), then performing a 0-extension (adding _MATH_), and finally adding the remaining edges of _MATH_, Lemmas _REF_ and _REF_ imply that _MATHDISP_. 
This contradicts the choice of _MATH_.
To determine whether any of the fractal or multifractal parameters _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, including _MATH_ as a reference, can distinguish flaring from non-flaring active regions, we perform two tests: a more stringent one, that compares the preflare (96 minutes in advance, at most, per the cadence of the full-disk MDI magnetograms) values of the parameters for flaring active regions to the peak values of the parameters for non-flaring regions, and a more liberal one, that compares the peak values of the parameters for both flaring and non-flaring regions. 
Finding a distinguishing pattern in the first test would mean that the studied parameter may have a short-term predictive capability. 
If the first test fails but the second test gives some distinguishing patterns, the studied parameter provides clues about the expected flare productivity of an active region, without necessarily implying when flares will occur. 
This claim is found in multiple instances in the literature ( e.g., _CITE_ for _MATH_; _CITE_ and _CITE_ for _MATH_; _CITE_ for other multifractal parameters).
From the metrics provided in this section, we now have a likelihood that the object is moving _MATH_, likely speed of the object _MATH_ and the uncertainty of the speed _MATH_.
Rotate _MATH_ such that its main axis coincides with the _MATH_-axis (or any other chosen fixed axis). 
In cases of _MATH_ or _MATH_ (i.e. rotation-symmetric shapes), no rotation is needed.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background of fractional order filter using two FCs of different orders _MATH_ and _MATH_ (_MATH_). 
Section 3 presents the design parameters and performance of fractional order filter through MATLAB simulation. 
The experimental results and discussions have been presented in Section 4, and concluding remarks are summarized in section 5.
To construct such a drawing, we start by embedding a spanning tree of _MATH_ respecting the rotation diagram, and then add the remaining edges respecting both the rotation diagram and homologies of cycles.
The real time detail extraction of the video sequence is the main consideration for multi-scale joint bilateral vido upsampling. 
To filter the video in real time to receive the video texture detail layer, we apply the Bilateral Grid techniques presented in _CITE_, then we can apply our Fast JBTU to efficiently perform upsampling.
Suppose that _MATH_ is given, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
For any fixed _MATH_, we have _MATH_, and by Theorem 5, _MATH_ _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_ is infinitesimal compared to _MATH_. 
From (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and the last equality follows from the mean value theorem of differential calculus. 
Since _MATH_, and _MATH_, we have _MATH_ _MATH_ _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_, where the quantity in curly brackets is a gamma density function for a continuous random variable _MATH_. 
In view of _MATH_, we can replace the _MATH_ on the right hand side of the last equality by any _MATH_, where _MATH_ can be arbitrarily small and is independent of the given _MATH_. 
This complete the proof.
 robust stabilization of the oxygen stoichiometry problem avoiding chattering effects;

 guaranteed extended range of operation, in spite of the highly nonlinear nature of plant;
the control law only depends on two measurable variables, namely the stack current and the compressor air flow, therefore no state observer is required;

Thus, we have proved the following decomposition theorem for _MATH_: 
If _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_, where:
 _MATH_ runs over _MATH_, and it has probability _MATH_ given by Lemma _REF_;
_MATH_ runs over pair of subspaces of dimension _MATH_ containing respectively _MATH_ and _MATH_, and it has uniform probability _MATH_ among these pairs of subspaces;
 _MATH_ (respectively, _MATH_) runs over subspaces satisfying the three conditions of Lemma _REF_ (respectively, Lemma _REF_), and it has uniform probability _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_) among them;
 and _MATH_ runs over trivial extensions of _MATH_ to _MATH_ and _MATH_ with the additional constraints _MATHDISP_; and it has uniform probability _MATH_ among these trivial extensions.
The equation of state, Eq. (_REF_), we rewrite it in the following form: _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_ 
This equation of state, Eq. (_REF_), we further rewrite in the form valid in high energy limit: _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
In this equation, the compressibility factor _MATH_ from Eq. (_REF_) coincides with Enskog factor in Eq. (_REF_). 
Therefore, the transport properties of the gas, which are characterizing by shear viscosity _MATH_, bulk viscosity _MATH_ and heat conductivity _MATH_ are detrmined by the calculations of _CITE_: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
The Enskog approximation, therefore, allows to find the relative changes of the transport coefficients of the system under the pressure whereas the initial values of these coefficients are given, see also calculations of _CITE_. 
In the limit of high energy, whereas _MATH_, keeping only the leading in _MATH_ terms, we obtain: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
We see, that the bulk viscosity _MATH_ is small in the limit of large final rapidity _MATH_ compared to the case when _MATH_ for our gas.
The value of the Debye length, Eq. (_REF_), depends on the particle density _MATH_ which may vary depending on the external conditions, i.e. the particle density of hot spot is not a constant. 
Therefore, we consider another parameter, called plasma parameter, which is defined as _MATHDISP_, and which we require to stay the same in the presence and absence of the external field _MATH_. 
From Eq. (_REF_) we see that in the case of the external pressure the Debye radius is smaller than in the case of the absence of the pressure: _MATHDISP_. 
Using Eq. (_REF_), Eq. (_REF_) we can estimate this effect of the change in the Debye length. 
First of all, consider the inverse of the parameter Eq. (_REF_) in the absence of the external field: _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_. 
with _MATH_ from Eq. (_REF_): _MATHDISP_. 
Simple integration gives: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the number of particles in the spot and _MATH_ is a positive constant. 
In the presence of the external field we have instead Eq. (_REF_) the expression Eq. (_REF_) with the potential given by Eq. (_REF_). 
Therefore, in the leading in _MATH_ order, we will obtain: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ are some positive constants. 
Integrating Eq. (_REF_) we obtain: _MATHDISP_ with some positive constant _MATH_. 
We require that both expressions Eq. (_REF_) and Eq. (_REF_) are equal and this gives for the Debye's length changes: _MATHDISP_ or _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ as some positive constant. 
As it was underlined in previous Section, see also _CITE_, the hydrodynamic description of the process is possible when the characteristic length of the system, in our case _MATH_, begins to decrease, i.e. Knudsen number of the system begins to decrease as well. 
We determine the Knudsen number as _MATHDISP_, and we indeed obtain that this number decreases when the external pressure is applied.
This study is limited to rigid bodies with regular geometries (such as rectangular, circular, and elliptical objects with constant densities). 
For a rigid body with irregular geometry and uneven density distribution, it is difficult to determine how the geometry and density-distribution modifications influence the motion. 
When a paper or plastic object falls freely, the shape can be deformed, a factor that was omitted in this study. 
Furthermore, we obtained the orientation of the rigid body from a precomputed trajectory database, but the rotational axis and angle of the rigid body were difficult to determine in the cases of spiral and helical motions, because they are related to its geometry and appear irregular, as observed by Razavi _CITE_.
_MATH_ First note that given the positive definite matrix-valued sequence _MATH_ defined over _MATH_ it is always possible to find a nonsingular matrix-valued sequence _MATH_ defined over _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
From condition ii) we have _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_. 
Now let _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATH_ turns out to be positive definite and Eq. _REF_ can be equivalently written as in _REF_. 
Now let us recall the following properties of the transition matrix _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
Now Eq. _REF_ easily follows from _REF_ whereas Eq. _REF_ is obtained computing _MATH_ from _REF_ and using _REF_.
A natural extension of the threshold ARCH processes that allows us to take into account both long memory property and asymmetry in the stochastic volatility (Goncalves, Leite, and Mendes-Lopes, 2012) is the TGARCH model with non-integer power-law index _MATH_. 
Moreover, the models of this general class are also well adapted for heavy tail data (as in the present case), since they are in general leptokurtic stochastic processes, that is, its kurtosis is greater than the standard value (3) of normal distribution. 
The combination of ARMA models with an error process following conditional heteroscedastic models greatly improves the adequacy of the fitting and it has been extensively studied in the stochastic literature and applied to real data (Weiss, 1984; Goncalves and Mendes-Lopes, 2008).
For any _MATH_, we let _MATHDISP_ denote the survival probability of the _MATH_-contact process started in _MATH_. 
Similarly, _MATH_ denotes the survival probability of the _MATH_-contact process. 
Setting _MATHDISP_ defines a stationary _MATH_-contact process whose invariant law _MATHDISP_ is uniquely characterized by _MATHDISP_. 
(To see this, note that the linear span of the functions _MATH_ with _MATH_ forms an algebra that separates points, hence by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem is dense in the space of continuous functions on _MATH_.) 
It is easy to see that _MATH_ is nontrivial, i.e., gives zero probability to the empty set, if and only if the _MATH_-contact process survives. 
Moreover, _MATH_ is the limit law of the process started with all sites infected, i.e., _MATH_ is the upper invariant law.
It remains to prove _MATH_. 
we let _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_. 
Using a change _MATH_ of variable in _MATH_ we obtain another form of it as follows. _MATHDISP_. 
The proof for _MATH_ is similar to the proof of _MATH_. 
Hence we obtain _MATH_ on _MATH_.
For games of complete information, such questions of dynamic stability have been addressed in a principled way by evolutionary game theory. 
That theory shows that certain subsets of Nash equilibrium (e.g., Evolutionary Stable States, ESS) are indeed reachable by players using simple adaptation rules (e.g., replication, imitation or learning); see, for example Weibull (1995), Friedman (1991) and Sandholm (2010) for games in normal form and Cressman (2003) for games in extensive form. 
For games of incomplete information, however, dynamic stability questions remain largely unresolved.
Formally, the SVM problem consists in finding the decision hyperplane _MATH_ described by _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ represents an instance, _MATH_ is a weight vector and _MATH_ is a constant. 
Each instance _MATH_, _MATH_ in the dataset must remain within a distance of 1 to the hyperplane, i.e. _MATH_ if _MATH_ and _MATH_ otherwise. 
This can be rewritten as: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ represents the label of _MATH_ in the dataset. 
The weight vector _MATH_ and the constant _MATH_ are learned by examining all the _MATH_ instances in the training data and their labels; in particular, the optimal _MATH_ can be found by maximizing (_REF_) using the method of Lagrange multipliers: _MATHDISP_ where each instance having a non-zero Lagrange multiplier _MATH_ is a support vector (SV). 
At this point, _MATH_ can be computed by taking into account the _MATH_ support vectors: _MATHDISP_ Classifying a new instance _MATH_ now simply implies computing _MATH_.
The location of the facula area was determined according to the image in white light. 
For more exact definition of fine-structured faculae elements, bright regions of the continuous spectrum on working spectrograms were used. 
Most of the faculae observed were situated near the limb. 
The connection of faculae to active regions was determined in the following way. 
If a facula was observed on the eastern limb and over the following three days at this place within a radius of 150^ the active region did not develop, the facula was considered not to be connected with the active region. 
For the western limb, the history of this region on the Sun over a period of three days before observations was considered. 
If there was a spot or part of the active region within a radius 150^ from the center of the facula, then the facula was considered as belonging to this active region. 
Faculae are long-lived objects, so our classification is rather conditional. 
Nevertheless, as can be seen below, a difference between these two groups is noted. 
Observations were usually carried out in a few spectral lines corresponding to different levels in the Sun's atmosphere (photosphere-chromosphere or photosphere-zone of temperature minimum). 
The spectral pairs H_MATH_ and Fe i 6569 √Ö, Ba ii 4554 √Ö and Fe i 4551.6 √Ö, Ca ii 8542 √Ö and Fe i 8538 √Ö were used most frequently. 
Part of the observations were undertaken with polarization optics, that later permitted us to obtain information on the longitudinal component of the magnetic field in lines Fe i 6569 √Ö, Ba ii 4554 √Ö, Ca ii 8542 √Ö. 
Over the period 2002 - 2004, 28 time series with an average duration of about an hour and 0.2- 5 seconds cadence were obtained. 
Of these, five were rejected on the grounds of bad atmospheric conditions. 
The atmospheric lines H_MATH_O close to H_MATH_ and Ca ii were used to remove spectrographic noise. 
LOS velocity was determined as the difference between intensities in the red and violet wings of the spectral line, normalized to their sum. 
To measure the magnetic field the centers of gravity _MATH_ and _MATH_ were calculated. 
FFT and wavelet-analysis were used for further analysis of the data. 
The horizontal lines in power spectra mark 95% significance level. 
Wavelet-analysis gives one the opportunity to examine the time distribution of separate modes and carry out their selective filtration. 
To check the statistical significance (95% level) a comparison was made with the theoretical spectrum of white noise according to Torrence and Compo (1998).
We have the following by Proposition _REF_ and Billingsley [3], Theorem 7.3, p. 82.
Given that the number of possible answers grows so quickly, it takes a great many bits to even express this answer. 
Needless to say, one needs at least _MATH_ samples to be able to determine the answer for _MATH_ in any setting, deterministic or random.
Information overloading can be addressed through machine learning techniques that organize and categorize large amounts of data. 
The two main techniques are classification and clustering. 
Classification is a supervised technique that assigns a class to each data item, by performing an initial training phase over a set of human annotated data, and a subsequent phase which applies the classification to the remaining elements. 
Clustering is an unsupervised technique that does not assume a-priori knowledge; data are grouped into categories on the basis of some measure of inherent similarity between instances, in such a way that objects in one cluster are very similar (compactness property) and objects in different clusters are different (separateness property). 
Similarity needsto be calculated in different ways based on the data types it involves, namely categorical, numeric, textual or mixed data. 
After the clusters are created, a labeling phase takes care of annotating each cluster with the most descriptive label.
It follows from _REF_ and _REF_ or, equivalently, from _REF_ and the second identity in _REF_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, that _MATHDISP_ implying _MATHDISP_
This system is made of a box in the front view, where the two horizontal wings are carrying the same lift and the lift distribution is the superposition of an elliptical part and a constant one; the induced velocity is constant and its value depends on the total lift. 
Along the vertical wings, the lift distribution is symmetric and butterfly shaped and the induced velocity is identically zero. 
In this configuration, an important parameter is the gap-to-span ratio, denoted _MATH_; as this ratio increases, the efficiency of the wing system increases correspondingly. 
In the interval _MATH_, this configuration achieves up to 30% reduction in induced drag with respect to a monoplane configuration (Fig. _REF_)
Step 2. 
Find schedule _MATH_, to be obtained either from _MATH_, if _MATH_ is polynomially solvable, or from _MATH_, if _MATH_ has a PTAS. 
Stop.
As noted above, we have estimated _MATH_ at room temperature. 
However, when laser radiation is absorbed, the bisphere particles and the surrounded medium are heated and this affects the elasticity modulus. 
It turns out that the latter is affected not only by the temperature but also by its time derivative (the rate of heating or cooling) _CITE_. 
The changes of the elasticity modulus during heating or cooling are related to breaking or re-establishing of chemical bonds in the polymer. 
This process is characterized by finite relaxation times. 
When heating by laser radiation is fast, the instantaneous value of the elasticity modulus can be different from the corresponding equilibrium value (computed at the instantaneous value of temperature). 
The magnitude of this effect can be estimated as follows. 
According to the theory of Ref. _CITE_, the average expectation time _MATH_ of a local (at one site of the polymeric grid) energy fluctuation _MATH_ depends on temperature _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ is the Boltzmann constant. 
The bond with the potential barrier _MATH_ will be destroyed when _MATH_. 
The average waiting time for this to happen is _MATHDISP_, which is the characteristic time of polymer relaxation into a new stable state with a smaller number of bonds between the molecules (corresponding to the changed temperature). 
It is more convenient to use the frequency of bond breaking, _MATH_. 
Then, using the analogy with the kinetic equations describing chemical reactions and assuming that the elasticity modulus is proportional to the number of bonds, we can write: _MATHDISP_.
The nonlinear character of the rotational degrees of freedom make the formulation and implementation of geometrically exact finite elements complex _CITE_. 
Also, it requires important modifications in the global structure of standard finite element, structural, or multibody codes. 
To sidestep all these problems, other beam formulations have been proposed in recent years. 
Among them, we will discuss the so-called Absolute Nodal Coordinate formulation of beams as proposed in _CITE_. 
These articles advocate the use of special interpolation functions that, employed in the context of a standard solid finite element, are rich enough so as to faithfully represent the kinematics of a beam-like solid. 
The resulting method is fairly simple but has its own drawbacks as discussed, for example, in _CITE_.
Suppose that _MATH_. 
By Claim 1, in the schedule obtained by LS with input _MATH_, the smallest load of a machine is equal to _MATH_; and since _MATH_ is assigned on machine _MATH_, by definition of LS, we have _MATHDISP_.
Define _MATH_ to be a Poisson process with jump rate _MATH_ at time _MATH_. 
Then, given the rates in Table _REF_ we have the following stochastic ODE, _MATHDISP_. where the second equation directly above applies for all _MATH_. 
Each _MATH_ in (_REF_) represents an independent Poisson process run at the specified rate, to avoid cumbersome notation we do not use a distinct notation for each of these processes. 
In (_REF_) and throughout this work, we ignore back mutations, a mutation from a variant to a less fit variant. 
Ignoring such mutations does not affect our results.
Let us introduce the asymptotic procedure for equation (_REF_). 
Note that, in case _MATH_, the right-hand side of equation (_REF_) is constant. 
So, following the idea of asymptotic integration, let us find phase transformation _MATHDISP_ where functions _MATH_ are such that the new phase variable also has a constant temporal rate even though _MATH_.
Hsu _CITE_ considers a discrete time queueing model in the context of computer communications systems subject to interruptions. 
Here the number of digits that arrive for transmission to a single server is modeled using a Poisson distribution. 
The transmission channel is subject to interruptions and they are modeled using a geometric distribution. 
The Z-transform of the density function of the buffer occupancy is obtained in steady state.
A nice set is totally-cover-decomposable if and only if it is infinite-cover-decomposable. 
We have to show that if we have a covering of some point set _MATH_ by the translates of our nice, infinite-cover-decomposable set _MATH_, then we can suitably color the points of _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the points that are covered by 2 copies of the same translate of the nice set _MATH_. 
Color one of these red, the other blue. 
Now we only have to deal with _MATH_ and we can suppose that there is only one copy of each translate. 
Now instead of coloring these translates, we rather show that we can choose countably many of them such that they still cover every point of _MATH_ many times. 
Using after this that the set is infinite-cover-decomposable finishes the proof. 
So now we show that if there is a set of translates of _MATH_ that cover every point of _MATH_ at least _MATH_ times, then we can choose countably many of these translates that cover every point of _MATH_ at least _MATH_ times. 
It is easy to see that it is enough if we show this for _MATH_ (since we can repeat this procedure _MATH_ times).
Figure _REF_ shows the time sequence maps of the LOS velocities, _MATH_, and _MATH_ in each data set, at the same FOV shown in Figure _REF_. 
We manually masked the area of the surge by examining images. 
After we applied the fitting to the pixels inside the masked area, we discarded the points where the velocity difference between the H_MATH_ and Ca ii lines was bigger than 5 km s_MATH_. 
As shown in the figure, the surge was obviously blueshifted in the early phase, then it changed to the redshift. 
H_MATH_ and Ca ii lines show the same LOS velocities. 
The LOS velocity started to vary in the eastern part of the surge first, while the western part of the surge followed the variation. 
At the early phase of the surge, temperature _MATH_ near the EB seems to be higher than the other part. 
Later, _MATH_ at the middle of the surge increased to about 40,000 K. 
The value of _MATH_ was higher than 15 km s_MATH_ initially, but it decreased to about 5 km s_MATH_ later.
The traditional approach in texture synthesis is to compare an image patch with that of an exemplar. 
For textures with strong structures, feature maps can be particularly helpful. 
It has been shown that some textures can be better synthesized with the aid of feature maps, which provides feature information. 
In our method, different from the binary feature maps used in _CITE_, we extract the detail layer of the exemplar as an extra channel for patch similarity computing. 
Then, a detail-aware texture optimization is applied, which combines both texture optimization and histogram matching of the image detail to furthermore improve the quality of the synthesized results. 
When our multi-scale joint bilateral upsampling operation performs on these better synthesized textures, we can receive more conceiving results.
Section 2 describes the class of SEMs to be considered. 
Section 3 describes the CDP and CDPM, discussing properties in the setting of SEMs. 
Section 4 describes the algorithm for posterior computation. 
Section 5 contains the simulation and real data examples, providing a proof of concept that non-normal latent variable densities can be estimated reliably. 
Section 6 discusses the results.
The annular _MATH_-medial axis is typically unbounded, so to apply a packing argument we need to define (in Section _REF_) a bounded subset of it, the trimmed annular _MATH_-medial axis. 
By definition, this object has dimension at most _MATH_ and we prove that its _MATH_-dimensional volume is bounded from above by a constant that does not depend on _MATH_. 
It follows that we can construct an _MATH_-sample _MATH_ of the trimmed annular _MATH_-medial axis with _MATH_ points.
Let _MATH_ and consider the problem _MATHDISP_. 
The corresponding variational formulation is _MATHDISP_. 
Because of the Friedrichs inequality _REF_, the form _MATH_ is coercive on _MATH_. 
Therefore, for any _MATH_, there exists a unique element _MATH_ satisfying _REF_. 
Moreover, _MATH_. 
This element is called a weak solution of the Dirichlet problem _REF_. 
It is clear that _REF_ is well-posed problem (in Hadamard's sense) for the choice _MATH_ and _MATH_ (or _MATH_).
Future work may alleviate some of these apparent shortcomings. 
In particular, other interpolation schemes might be used in place of splines; and Eq. (_REF_), which is the most flexible part of the algorithm, might be replaced with something that is found to be better. 
Also, the algorithm in its current form cannot pass fold points. 
In ongoing work we are reformulating the algorithm with infinitesimal parameter increments resulting in ODEs governing the evolution of the ordered set of points; after suitable reparametrization, this should allow the algorithm to pass fold points.
At any rate, a successful mount operation returns a file-handle to the client system, which stores it in the remote mount table. 
The client is now ready to issue file system operations, such as file open or create requests. 
Let's consider a create in order to maintain the similarity between our local and remote cases. 
The arguments to a create request are the pathname of the file to be created and the access rights that should be used. 
The client file system will recognize that the desired file is on a remote-mounted disk while scanning the pathname, by encountering a pathname prefix that leads to a file system mount point. 
When this occurs, the suffix of the pathname and the access permission information are marshalled into an XDR message, which is sent with the mount handle to the remote server. 
Again, there are two modes; in one, the XDR request is signed cryptographically (permitting the remote server to protect against attacks); in the other more common mode, any request with a valid mounted volume handle is trusted, and no attempt is made to verify the user-id or group-id information. 
The remote server will receive the create request, perform the operation, package up the result into an XDR reply message, and send the reply back to the client system.
For non-interacting electrons at zero temperature the total current from region _MATH_ of Eq. (_REF_) can alternatively be expressed as a surface integral _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the unit vector perpendicular to the surface element _MATH_, the surface _MATH_ is perpendicular to the longitudinal geometry of our system and _MATH_ are the eigenstates of _MATH_. 
The electrode-junction-electrode system is infinitely extended and non-periodic. 
In practice, of course, we can only deal with finite systems and therefore we only propagate the initial wavefuction projected onto the central region _MATH_. 
The presence of the leads is taken into account by applying the correct boundary conditions. 
It is worth to note that even for interacting electrons one can use Eq. (_REF_) to compute the current through the junction if the single-particle orbitals _MATH_ are the Kohn-Sham orbitals of time-dependent density functional theory.
_CITE_ construct high-resolution local DEMs of lunar impact craters with the integrated method based on shadow and shading described in Section _REF_. 
It is not possible, however, to obtain the required images from existing image archives of lunar spacecraft missions, as these generally do not contain several images of a surface region under sufficiently different illumination conditions. 
Hence, telescopic lunar CCD images were used again. 
Selenographic positions were obtained from _CITE_. 
The three-dimensional reconstruction approach described in Section _REF_ assumes that the grey value _MATH_ of a pixel is proportional to the incident flux _MATH_. 
However, for many cameras it is possible to adjust the gamma value _MATH_ manually from within the camera control software, causing the grey value _MATH_ to be proportional to _MATH_. 
Hence, a calibration of the gamma scale in the camera control software was performed by evaluating flatfield frames of different intensities acquired through different neutral density filters with known transmission coefficients, then fitting a characteristic curve of the form _MATH_ to the measured flatfield intensities.
Proof. 
Partitioning the matrices _MATH_ and _MATH_ as _MATHDISP_ and define the following matrices _MATHDISP_ It is easy to verify that _MATH_ by the fact _MATH_. 
Pre-and post-multiplying (44) by _MATH_ and its transpose, respectively, and using the following denotations _MATHDISP_ then one can obtain LMI (47). 
Pre-and post-multiplying (47) by _MATH_ and its transpose, respectively, and using the (51)-(52), it is clear that (44) can be achieved. 
Using the similar discussion as in Theorem 2, it is seen that (43) is equivalent to _MATHDISP_ 
By Schur complement, (53) is equivalent to _MATHDISP_ Pre-and post-multiplying (54) (or (48)) by _MATH_ (or _MATH_) and its transpose, respectively, and using the denotations in (51)-(52), then we can obtain (48) (or (54)). 
Therefore, condition (43) is equivalent to LMI (48).
The previous results used a training noise level of 0.15. 
The effect of different levels of noise in the training data is now considered. 
The genetic fuzzy system is trained using noisy data with noise levels (training noise level) of 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15. 
These genetic fuzzy systems are then tested using noisy data for noise levels of 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15. 
The effects of various training noise levels are studied by comparing the minimum and average success rates of the genetic fuzzy system with training noise levels of 0.05 and 0.10 with the minimum and average success rates of the genetic fuzzy system with a training noise level of 0.15 for various testing noise levels. 
_MATH_ indicates the difference between the success rates with a training noise level of 0.05 compared with the success rates with a training noise level of 0.15. 
A similar definition is used for _MATH_.
The similarities suggest that the simulations are closely tracking the behaviour of the observations. 
The creation of the hot coronal loops due to reconnection on the west side is clearly seen. 
The simulations show that compression is dominant on the east side, and we see evidence of this in the observations also. 
However the magnitude of the upflows at late stages of the flux emergence are not replicated in the simulations. 
There are two reasons for this. 
Firstly in the observations the new emerging flux interacts not only with the positive footpoint it emerges in to but also the negative footpoint at the other side of the active region at later times. 
Evidence of compression has been observed before by _CITE_, evidence for large-scale reconnection observed by _CITE_ through the formation of large-scale loops and evidence for small-angle reconnection as was seen by _CITE_. 
In our example there is evidence for all three mechanisms working which drive upflows. 
This is supported by the relationship between the line width and the Doppler velocity that is found to be different on each side of the emerging bipole. 
This allows us to extricate the different relationships for different mechanisms: (a) compression appears to show a small range of line width for the range of Doppler velocities (b) reconnection upflows show a linear relationship between the negative Doppler velocity and the line width (c) cooling plasma following reconnection shows a linear relationship between positive Doppler velocity and line width.
Let us assume this claim for the moment and conclude the proof of the theorem. 
For _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, one has _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, the current-valued map _REF_, which can be rewritten because of _REF_ (for _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_) as _MATHDISP_, extends as a holomorphic function of _MATH_ to _MATH_ for some _MATH_, the value at _MATH_ being equal to _MATHDISP_, which is independent of _MATH_ and annihilated (as a current) by _MATH_. 
This proves that _MATH_ fulfills conditions 1 and 2 in Definition _REF_.
We consider a triplet _MATH_. 
The operator associated with _MATH_ and its part in _MATH_ are denoted by _MATH_ and by _MATH_, respectively. 
The operator _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_) is a sectorial operator of _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_) with angle _MATH_. 
The operator _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_) is regarded as a realization of the strongly elliptic operator _MATH_ in _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_) under the Neumann type boundary conditions _MATHDISP_.
We study the temporal variation of subsurface flows of 828 active regions and 978 quiet regions. 
The horizontal flows cover a range of depths from the surface to about 16 Mm and are determined by analyzing Global Oscillation Network Group high-resolution Doppler data with ring-diagram analysis. 
The vertical-velocity component is derived from the divergence of the measured horizontal flows using mass conservation. 
For comparison, we analyze Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) Dynamics Run data covering 68 active regions common to both data sets. 
We determine the change in unsigned magnetic flux during the disk passage of each active region using MDI magnetograms binned to the ring-diagram grid. 
We then sort the data by their flux change from decaying to emerging flux and divide the data into five subsets of equal size. 
We find that emerging flux has a faster rotation than the ambient fluid and pushes it up, as indicated by enhanced vertical velocity and faster-than-average zonal flow. 
After active regions are formed, downflows are established within two days of emergence in shallow layers between about 4 and 10 Mm. 
Emerging flux in existing active regions shows a similar scenario where the upflows at depths greater than about 10 Mm are enhanced and the already established downflows at shallower depths are weakened. 
When active regions decay, the corresponding flow pattern disappears as well; the zonal flow slows down to values comparable to that of quiet regions and the upflows get weaker at deeper layers. 
The residual meridional velocity is mainly poleward and shows no obvious variation. 
The magnitude of the residual velocity, defined as the sum of the square of the residual velocity components, increases with increasing magnetic flux and decreases with decreasing flux.
The assumption of an exact solution of the ODE-IVP _REF_ for a single instance of the parameter vector _MATH_ in _MATH_ work and memory is not realistic. 
Thus to still achieve the rate of best _MATH_-term approximation also for the approximate partial sums _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ are the mentioned approximate Taylor coefficients, the effort for computing the coefficients has to be balanced against the respective impact for approximating _MATH_. 
In doing so, we obtain an adaptive approximate numerical solution of the parametric ODE-IVP _REF_ to a prescribed accuracy _MATH_ uniformly on the entire parameter domain _MATH_. 
This ultimately enables us to approximately calculate all further relevant information about the parametric solution (e.g. statistical moments), again up to an arbitrary prescribed accuracy, by several classes of adaptive approximation algorithms based on Galerkin projection (see, e.g. _CITE_) or by sparse collocation as in _CITE_ or by adaptive truncation _REF_ of the Taylor expansions _REF_ as in _CITE_.
Seals and bearings are also important components in rotordynamic systems, adding stiffness and damping to the rotor at particular node locations. 
Given that _MATH_ is the generalized displacement vector at the node point corresponding to the bearing/seal location, the vector differential equation for the stiffness and damping contribution is _MATHDISP_. 
The matrix _MATH_ is the damping matrix, and _MATH_ is the stiffness matrix of the bearing or seal. 
These matrices are design parameters that are commonly provided by the manufacturer, and in many cases they are functions of the shaft speed.
The situation in the abnormal parity sector is quite different since chiral symmetry is not preserved there. 
This means that _MATH_- cannot be written using simple chiral covariant blocks like _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and their chiral covariant derivatives and this complicates considerably its calculation and even its proper mathematical definition beyond perturbation theory _CITE_. 
In addition, the operator _MATH_ in (_REF_) is not of the Klein-Gordon type, in fact, it is not even local. 
The obvious method is to use _MATH_ as Klein-Gordon operator (to obtain _MATH_). 
The computation through the heat kernel of _MATH_ or its _MATH_-function becomes quite involved due to the lack of full chiral symmetry (vector symmetry is preserved).
Vibrations of various kinds with time delay can be governed by delay differential equations _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_. 
Every periodic solution of the differential equation (_REF_) is a solution of the integro-differential equation (see _CITE_) _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the corresponding Generalized Green's function.
Note that if _MATH_ is of the form (_REF_), then the generalized principal value _MATH_ for operator _MATH_ on _MATH_ equals to _MATH_. 
The assumptions (1), (2) and (3) above were used to guarantee that the associated Schrodinger operator _MATH_ has a spectral gap and has an _MATH_-eigenfunction corresponding to _MATH_.
From a biological perspective, as observed in the experiments, if there is no further stimulus, the water channels will be shut down and the water transport stops. 
Note that the flytrap has not crossed the semi-closed state yet and the inner layer still contains more water than the outer layer. 
By (F), more water returns to the inner layer and fills it up again. 
Hence the flytrap lobes are released and transition from the semi-closed state to the open state.
From (_REF_), we get _MATHDISP_, from which we derive that the _MATH_ norm of the solution to problem (_REF_) does not blow up in finite time. 
From Remark 2, we know that this is impossible. 
Therefore, we have _MATH_.
Wiener and Bigelow described the more philosophical aspects of this work in an essay written with the physiologist Arturo Rosenblueth, a friend of Wiener's. 
This paper described an approach to the study of behaviour which emphasized the observable inputs to and outputs from an object; this 'behaviourstic' approach was contrasted with a 'functional' approach which described behaviour by giving an account of the internal structure and workings of objects. 
As a result, Wiener and his collaborators were able to argue that "a uniform behavioristic analysis is applicable to both machines and living organisms". 
One motivation for this approach was that it offered a uniform approach to studying systems, such as antiaircraft batteries, that had both human and mechanical components.
As there are plenty of other important problems we can merely touch on, we will try to mitigate this lack by giving references where aspects important in actuarial applications are discussed in greater detail. 
We do however not aim at giving a full overview over the rapidly expanding literature relevant in this context. 
Hence the present text may be best characterized as a tutorial with particular emphasis laid on crucial points which, from my personal point of view, have often not attracted the interest they deserve.
The transient dynamic of a two degree-of-freedom system linked to a nonlinear energy sink by means of a essential nonlinear stiffness has been investigated analytically by using an original asymptotic expansion based on Manevitch's complexification method and featuring two small independent scales. 
The analytical study naturally exhibited two activation energy thresholds for targeted energy transfer likely to develop. 
Scenarios were also introduced to a priori forecast which and how competitive _MATH_ mechanisms are triggered knowing initial energies. 
An academic instance involving a two-storey building model was numerically simulated for comparison with analytical trends. 
Numerical results are in good agreement with expected analytical behaviors and thus validate _MATH_ scenarios. 
Futur prospect are now focusing on design methodologies to optimize energy pumping efficiency in the case of multiple _MATH_ mechanisms in competition.
It will be shown in the section 5 (Local Observations) of this chapter. That Bell's inequalities are consistent with quantum theory if we take into account the spatial dependence of the wave function and locality of detectors separated at the large enough distance.
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ the solutions of the problem (1)-(4) corresponding to the data _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively and _MATHDISP_.
The set of basic components is: _MATH_, where, each component is a discrete event component with priorities (Definition _REF_). 
In Fig. _REF_, the sub-nodes CA, LM, DM and DA are basic components.
Now, we have that _MATH_ has two identical asymptotes that are perpendicular to the _MATH_-axis (by Propositions _REF_, _REF_ and Step (ii) of the algorithm). 
Suppose first that _MATH_ is not entirely critical. 
Then, _MATH_ has at least two generalized critical values (the infimum and supremum values of the _MATH_-coordinates of its points) and this number, counted with multiplicity, is even (it is the number of local extremums of the _MATH_-coordinates). 
Thus, since _MATH_ has exactly one critical point, _MATH_ has exactly 2 generalized critical values and _MATH_ exactly one. 
It follows that _MATH_ has exactly 2 generalized critical points and _MATH_ exactly one since none of these branches is entirely critical. 
Indeed, _MATH_ is not entirely critical by assumption and neither _MATH_ nor _MATH_ is entirely critical because they both admit an asymptote whose projection onto the _MATH_-plane is parallel to the _MATH_-axis. 
Indeed, as argued in the proof of correctness of the algorithm, the direction of each projected asymptote is invariant by continuous deformation on the set of triplets of lines in general position and it follows from Proposition _REF_ and the analysis of one example that, in projection, both _MATH_ and _MATH_ admit an asymptote that is orthogonal to the one of _MATH_ and thus that is parallel to the _MATH_-axis.
The magnitude of the experimentally obtained values _MATH_ have to be corrected for the reduced gas density according to Eq. _REF_ at the location of the flamefront due to temperature elevation of gases in the reaction zone. 
These corrected values _MATH_ can then be compared to the laminar burning velocity _MATH_. 
Since the gas density at the location of the flamefront was not measured, _MATH_ was estimated as follows: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the temperature at the position of the flamefront pixel-line and _MATH_ the initial temperature of the reactant gas flow. 
_MATH_ was not directly accessible from the experimental data set. 
Thus laminar premixed flame model calculations were conducted to obtain estimates for _MATH_. 
The PREMIX code _CITE_ was used for burner stabilised one-dimensional flames with a known flux of reactants. 
For given stoichiometries, temperature as well as OH-radical concentration profiles were calculated. 
Recalling from section _REF_, the flamefront was selected at the position of maximum gradient in the concentration contour of the OH-radical. 
Accordingly, temperatures calculated at these maximimum gradient isocontours were substituted for _MATH_ in Eq. _REF_. 
The ratios _MATH_ were found to be _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, respectively, for the investigated stoichiometries of 0.550, 0.625 and 0.700.
Family 2: "Low wage family with an active female". 
Same as family 1 only the woman also works full time at the minimum wage.
As pointed out in the introduction of the chapter, the control of the variables associated to the solar conversion units depends very much of the type of system. 
In the case of photovoltaic (PV) systems, this involves the control of the voltage and intensity produced by the solar cells in order to operate at the maximum efficiency point and the control of the associated DC/AC conversion power electronics.
In order to informally test the diagnostic capabilities of the system, collaborative discussion sessions were also performed on the light field display. 
Three expert radiologists and physicians discussed the volume visualization of some anonymous data sets. 
Data sets were rendered by employing the Maximum Intensity Projection or X-ray volume rendering technique (figure _REF_). 
These techniques are depth-oblivious, and do not provide useful depth cues in static bi-dimensional rendering.
We refer to _MATH_ as likelihood, i.e., how likely it is to see this specific data (18 survivals out of 20) if _MATH_ is in fact 0.85. 
We can express the probability of the specific data we have observed (i.e., 18 survivals out of 20) as a function of different values of _MATH_. 
We refer to this function as the likelihood function. 
For the above example, the likelihood function is _MATHDISP_
We define the cartesian product (or cross product) _MATH_ of sets _MATH_ and _MATH_ to be the set of all ordered pairs _MATH_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
There is no requirement that _MATH_ and _MATH_ be disjoint; in fact, it is often useful to consider _MATH_.
From (_REF_), _MATH_ can be given by _MATHDISP_ 
Since it is well-known that the amplitude of OFDM signal, _MATH_ has a Rayleigh distribution, _MATH_ can be expressed as follows: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the Rayleigh probability density function (pdf). 
Then, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the upper incomplete gamma function, _MATHDISP_, and, _MATH_ is the complementary error function, _MATHDISP_. 
If we assume the input power of the OFDM signal is normalized to unity, _MATH_ can be represented as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Note that a similar result is independently derived in _CITE_. 
Then, _MATH_ can be easily approximated as _MATH_, i.e. _MATH_, due to the tail characteristic of Rayleigh distribution _CITE_. 
In Fig. _REF_, we compare the analysis with the simulations when the number of subcarriers are 64 and 1024. 
Since we use the Gaussian characteristics of OFDM signals, the analysis and simulation results are well-matched, especially in the case that the number of subcarriers is sufficiently large.
RHESSI IMAGES AND SPATIAL CORRELATION OF H_MATH_, TRACE AND HXR SOURCES
The previous graph results are recalled in summary in Section _REF_, where additional examples are computed using Mathematica. 
In Section _REF_, new results are obtained and some previous results are improved by eliminating adjacency matrices, thereby removing the consideration of matrix multiplication in determining computational complexity.
We demand that if there is no a-priori information about the password, then it cannot be guessed from its obfuscation alone. 
Formally, if the password has full min-entropy, its obfuscation looks like that of any other password.
While there is not a one-to-one relationship between the categories used in solar cycle predictions and those used to predict the stock market, some concepts may be transferable. 
What sets the solar cycle apart is an underlying system that can be represented by a physics-based model.
In the case of a bi-sphere the first order correction to the scattering coefficients _MATH_ with _MATH_ can be presented in the following form _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is given in Eq. _REF_ and we neglected second order corrections to the denominator, which would modify real and imaginary parts of the resonance frequency of _MATH_-th mode obtained in the single-mode approximation. 
This perturbation theory would brake down if in the vicinity of the main resonant frequency, _MATH_, modes with several other values of _MATH_ would also have their resonances with high enough values of _MATH_. 
This situation is quite possible at least for some values of _MATH_, as it was pointed out in Ref. _CITE_. 
If this happens, all resonant modes must be treated exactly, while the rest of them can still be treated perturbatively (see details in Ref. _CITE_).
Abstract: 
This paper is concerned with the problem of robust exponential stability for T-S fuzzy stochastic neural networks of neutral type. 
Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and stochastic analysis approach, new delay-dependent stability criteria is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be checked easily by the LMI Control Toolbox in MATLAB. 
Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
We have obtained some results which may be helpful to understanding the cause and effects of the sunspot rotation. 
A consequence of the sunspot rotation is the injection of magnetic helicity. 
Since the sunspot rotated in the counter-clockwise direction, it must have injected magnetic helicity of negative sign. 
This is manifested by the gradual formation of the inverse S-shaped structure (or sigmoid) seen in the XRT images. 
This is consistent with _CITE_'s suggestion that the transport of helicity from the low atmosphere to the corona is related to the sunspot rotation. 
The helicity injected through AR 10930 for the period of four days from 10 to 13 December was about _MATH_ Mx_MATH_ according to the measurements done by _CITE_ using the SOHO/MDI data. 
This helicity injection may be related to the rotation of the sunspot as well as its eastward motion, and may be responsible for the highly -sheared magnetic fields in this active region, in line with _CITE_'s suggestion.
The change of the sign of the positive and negative magnetic flux imbalance _MATH_ can be expressed by the following formula: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ (_MATH_ corresponds to the odd solar cycle, _MATH_ to the even one); _MATH_ (_MATH_ corresponds to the interval of the 11-year cycle from the minimum up to the reversal; _MATH_ to the interval from the reversal up to the minimum). 
In this way, the imbalance sign will be determined by two factors: the parity of the solar cycle on one hand, and the phase of the 11-year cycle on the other hand.
Finally, the effects of the transverse field on the specific heat and the dielectric susceptibility are shown in Figs. 5a and 5b. 
The parameters in Figs. 5 are selected as: _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_. 
From these figures we can conclude that the phase transition temperature decreases with the increase of the transverse field, which is similar to the case of ferroelectric or antiferroelectric interfacial coupling in bilayer [53,54]. 
The free energy and internal energy of the bilayer are given in Figs. 5c and 5d for the same parameters selected in the study of the susceptibility and specific heat. 
We can see that the free energy increases while the internal energy decreases as the value of the transverse field increases.
The great majority, i.e. more than 90%, of practical controllers are of PID-type, and have order, structure and action constraints. 
Therefore, realistic performance indicators should be applied for their assessment, as first proposed by Eriksson and Isaksson (1994) and Ko and Edgar (1998). 
These approaches calculate a lower bound of the variance by restricting the controller type to PID only (optimal PID benchmarking) and allow for more general disturbance models. 
An explicit "one-shot" solution for the closed-loop output was derived by Ko and Edgar (2004) as a function of PID settings. 
Recent developments in this pragmatic direction have been worked out in Horton et al. (2003) and Huang (2003). 
Moreover, Grimble (2002b, Grimble 2003) provided a theoretical framework on the topic, referred to as restricted-structure controller benchmarking.
In line with the biologically organised fluxes of energy, the human population has socially organised fluxes of energy, while the production system of society plays the role of a mechanism attracting energy from out-of-body sources. 
Prime sources of energy (the remains of the former biospheres: wood, coal, oil; direct and indirect solar energy in form of wind, water, tides: energy of fission and fusion of nuclei) are used via different appliances to transform matter of the natural environment into things of the artificial environment creating useful for the humans complexity. 
The ways of utilisation of energy by humans has been considered in previous chapters in some details.
Calculations of spectral darkening and visibility functions for the brightness oscillations of the Sun due to global solar oscillations are presented. 
This has been done for a broad range of the visible and infrared continuum spectrum. 
The procedure for the calculations of these functions includes the numerical computation of depth-dependent derivatives of the opacity caused by p modes in the photosphere. 
A radiative transport code was used for this purpose in order to get the disturbances of the opacities due to temperature and density fluctuations. 
The visibility and darkening functions are obtained for adiabatic oscillations under the assumption that the temperature disturbances are proportional to the undisturbed temperature of the photosphere. 
The latter assumption is the only way to explore any opacity effects since the eigenfunctions of p mode oscillations have not been obtained so far. 
This investigation reveals that opacity effects have to be taken into account since they dominate the violet and infrared part of the spectrum. 
Due to this, the visibility functions are negative for those parts of the spectrum. 
Furthermore, the darkening functions show a wavelength dependent change of sign for some wavelengths due to these opacity effects. 
However, the visibility and darkening functions under the assumptions used are in contradiction with observations of global p mode oscillations. But it is beyond any doubt that the opacity effects influence the brightness fluctuations of the Sun due to global oscillations.
There may be errors in the positioning of the receiver on the axis of the parabola which is formed by the mirrors, errors in the parabolic mirror shape itself, errors in solar tracking which cause reflected rays not to intercept the absorber, etc. 
All of these possible errors are included in the intercept factor, _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ be a common multiplier of _MATH_ and _MATH_ (for instance, _MATH_). 
The last inequalities remain true, when replacing every _MATH_ by _MATH_. 
Thus, for any _MATH_: _MATHDISP_.
At least some stability problems can be avoided if the points _MATH_ coincide with the definition domain of some system of orthogonal polynomials. 
The most useful in regression are orthogonal polynomials of a discrete variable. 
These are polynomials _MATH_ that are linearly independent and orthogonal on a discrete set of points _MATH_ in the sense _MATHDISP_ with some weight _MATH_. 
The model function fitted to the data can be designed as the linear combination _MATH_. 
We determine the expansion coefficients _MATH_ by minimizing the measure of deviation (_REF_). 
We obtain _MATHDISP_. 
From the condition for the mimimum _MATH_ we get _MATH_ or _MATHDISP_.
In the row version of the standard forward and backward substitution algorithms for solving triangular systems, the outer loop of the substitution for each unknown is sequential. 
The inner loop is a vector dot product of a sparse row vector of the triangular matrix and the dense right-hand-side vector _MATH_. 
In the column oriented versions, the inner loop is a saxpy operation of a sparse column vector and the vector _MATH_. 
These dot product and saxpy operations can be split and parallelized but this approach is not efficient in general since the length of the vector involved is usually short.
_MATH_: _MATH_ means modulus. 
The superscripts _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ mean conjugate, transpose and the matrix inverse, respectively. 
_MATH_ means the _MATH_ row _MATH_ column element of a matrix. 
_MATH_ means the continuous Fourier transform. 
Finally, _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the discrete Fourier transform and the inverse discrete Fourier transform, respectively.
To differentiate Class 1 from Class 2 on the decoding side, a location map is created by assigning '1' to _MATH_ in Class 1 and a '0' to _MATH_ in Class 2. 
This map's length just accounts for a small portion of all pixel pairs. 
After it is losslessly compressed, the compressed bit length is further smaller than that in DE method. 
Thereby, our method increases the hiding capacity.
For the three cycles considered by us, Equation (_REF_) correctly describes the change of the North-South asymmetry of magnetic fields shown in Figure _REF_. 
As has been stated in the Introduction, a number of works established the change of dominant hemisphere for the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle. 
This effect was observed for different manifestations of solar activity (see _CITE_, and references in the Introduction). 
Rapid transition from the domination of the northern hemisphere to the domination of the southern one after the magnetic-field reversal has been observed for sunspot areas _CITE_ and for solar flares _CITE_. 
A reverse change from the southern hemisphere to the northern one during the solar minimum was found for sunspots _CITE_. 
As the change of the photospheric magnetic field determines the cyclic change of various indices of solar activity the proposed formula can be interpreted as a generalization of some of the results cited above.
The presented model has the capability to be used for determining the behavior of a bubble cluster. 
However the effects of parameters mentioned above are studied for a three-bubble interaction in a wide range of parameter domain. 
Through analyzing the results more comprehensive knowledge would be available about the complex and nonlinear dynamics of bubble clusters. 
The present study has been conducted by considering the conventional single frequency source, which is defined as _CITE_: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the frequency of the driving sound field and _MATH_ is the amplitude of the driving pressure. 
In order to perform an analysis of the Takahira model for a cluster (Eq. (1)), it is convenient to transform the second-order differential into an autonomous system of first-order differential equations (Appendix A).
One issue remains. 
It could be that the segment _MATH_ identified above is the base of a curvature triangle, rather than a segment of _MATH_, in which case it cannot be used for joining the halves. 
Returning to Fig. _REF_, there are two cases: (a) _MATH_, and (b) _MATH_. 
In case (a), _MATH_ is the base of a curvature triangle, with the angle at either endpoint of the base larger than _MATH_. 
Note that edges adjacent to _MATH_ must be edges of _MATH_. 
Regardless of the angle at which _MATH_ intersects _MATH_, one of these two adjacent edges must include supporting portion of _MATH_, for example, visible from _MATH_ in Fig. _REF_(b,c). 
In case (b), two curvature triangles are inserted, but as we noted earlier, neither is truly needed, for the boundary of _MATH_ (_MATH_ in Lemma _REF_) is already convex at the apexes of the two curvature triangles. 
So, simply not inserting them leaves an edge of _MATH_ crossed by _MATH_ that can serve as _MATH_. 
So, in all situations, we obtain a supporting segment.
if _MATH_ and _MATH_ are state formulas, then _MATH_,_MATH_ and _MATH_ are state formulas.
In a Node, an event occurring in one sub-node may be synchronous with some other events occurring in some other sub-nodes. 
A synchronization vector _MATH_, in the Node _MATH_, describes a particular synchronization pattern between sub-nodes of _MATH_. 
More specifically, the sub-nodes with events presented in the vector are synchronized, while the other sub-nodes that are marked by _MATH_ remain unchanged. 
However, in several models, these synchronization vectors _CITE_ are not expressive enough. 
For instance, let us consider an electric circuit with several lamps. 
When the event "power failure" occurs, all the lamps are simultaneously put out. 
But some of them are already off and cannot execute "light off". 
Although it is possible to model this circuit with synchronization vectors in such a way that in case of power failure, only lighted lamps turn off, this increases the size of the model.
The model can be summarized graphically by two schedules in the _MATH_ space (Panel (a) of Fig. 1). 
The vacancy creation (VC) schedule (see (_REF_)) is downward sloping and convex toward the origin, reflecting diminishing returns in vacancy creation. 
A lower wage rate induces firms to create more vacancies. 
The wage setting (WS) schedule (see (_REF_)) is linear and upward sloping. 
At higher rates of labor market tightness the worker gets a larger share of the pure rents associated with a labor contract (via a higher wage). 
The long-run equilibrium is represented by E_MATH_. 
Panel (b) of Fig. 1 shows the Beveridge Curve (BC), which is downward sloping and convex to the origin in the _MATH_ space (see Blanchard and Diamond, 1989). 
Intuitively, if there are more vacancies, unemployment is lower because unemployed household members find it easier to locate a job. 
The ray through the origin represents the equilibrium vacancy-unemployment ratio (i.e., the indicator of labor market tightness (LMT)). 
Equilibrium unemployment and vacancies are at the intersection of the LMT and BC curves.
In this paper, we compare two approaches for determining the amplitude equations; namely, the integral equation method and the method of multiple scales. 
To describe and compare the methods, we consider three examples: the parametric resonance of a Van der Pol oscillator under state feedback control with a time delay, the primary resonance of a harmonically forced Duffing oscillator under state feedback control with a time delay and the primary resonance together with 1:1 internal resonance of a two-degree-of-freedom model. 
Using the integral equation method and the method of multiple scales, the amplitude equations are obtained. 
The stability of the periodic solution is examined by using the Floquet theorem together with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion (without time delay) and the Nyquist criterion (with time delay). 
By comparison with the solution obtained by the numerical integration, we find that the accuracy of the integral equation method is much better.
We now prove the upper bound. 
A set of points ordered from left to right is said to form an ascending chain if their _MATH_-coordinates form a non-decreasing sequence. 
Similarly, a descending chain of points is a sequence of points with non-increasing _MATH_-coordinates. 
The first step is to observe that an ascending or descending chain with _MATH_ points can be traversed by a path with at most _MATH_ links. 
Moreover, the direction of the last (or first) link in the chain can be specified in advance to horizontal or vertical (e.g., by an easy inductive path construction). 
An axis-parallel path is said to be an ascending path if it can traversed so that each link is oriented rightwards or upwards (in the positive direction of the _MATH_ or _MATH_-axis). 
Similarly, a descending path is one that can traversed so that each link is oriented to the right or downwards.
The peak-to-peak change in blade root forces and moments, for varying effective strain ratio are plotted in Fig. _REF_.
From the uncertainty principle, the length scale in the NJL model is _MATH_. 
Taking the standard cutoff value _MATH_ MeV _CITE_, we have _MATH_ fm. 
This means that, the quark potential calculated in the NJL model might be reasonable in the region of _MATH_ fm. 
In the short range the model is probably not applicable. 
While we will take a covariant Pauli-Villars regularization scheme which allows us to do the momentum integrations in the whole region without an explicit cutoff, we still focus only on the long range behavior of the quark potential with _MATH_ fm.
Equation (_REF_) is computed for _MATH_, since _MATH_ is, at least, the sum of the single reader responses plus those colliding reader signals (at least 2 per collision). 
Finally, the best guess number of neighboring readers is computed as: _MATHDISP_
For TM wave, the situation is a little complicated because the metal grid is imbedded in an anisotropic medium here. 
According to _MATH_'s theorem about the Babinet principle used in electrically anisotropic meium _CITE_, the field of TM wave could be transformed to its complementary filed of TE wave by transforming the coordinate system (assuming the mesh is along _MATH_-axis): _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ are coordinates for TM wave and _MATH_ are coordinates for TE wave. 
Then, using the Babinet principle _CITE_, the grid impedance for TM wave could be determined as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and the grid impedance for complementary TE wave _MATH_ could be obtained by solving the equ.(5), with the parameters _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ being adjusted accordingly.
A second example is the general shift towards services-oriented enterprises. 
Our economy is increasingly becoming a services economy. 
Consumers, clients and citizens do not 'just' expect a product anymore. 
They expect integrated service offerings that are updated at the same pace as their own needs change _CITE_. 
The shift towards a services oriented economy makes it that enterprises need to reposition themselves as service providers, while making clear choices about their core competencies, the position they want to take in the value chain _CITE_, their core competencies, and the services/products they offer. 
As a result, enterprises increasingly turn into networked organizations where each node of the network focuses on its core competencies, while outsourcing other business functions to other nodes _CITE_. 
In other words, present day enterprises are required to become service-oriented enterprises comprising of a dynamic network of organizations that collectively provide services.
The availability of large firm-level data-bases enables tax researchers to study firms' behavioral response to effective profit tax rates (e.g., in terms of investment, sales and employment). 
A fairly recent strand of literature exploits micro-level information on profit taxes - so-called backward-looking effective profit tax rates, which are defined as the ratio between a firm's profit tax payments and its operating profits (see, e.g., Kemsley, 1998; Desai, Foley, and Hines, 2004; Mutti and Grubert, 2004). 
One notable advantage of such data is the variation in tax rates even within countries, which facilitates identification of firms' response to taxation. 
However, a major drawback of backward-looking rates is that tax liabilities may be affected by firms' tax planning activities (for instance, higher investments in the past are associated with an increased amount of current depreciation allowances and, hence, with lower tax payments). 
Thus, backward-looking effective tax rates are inherently prone to endogeneity inducing possibly biased estimation results (see Devereux and Griffith, 2002, for a discussion).
The forces depicted in Figure _REF_ are acting in the chosen positive direction, which aligns with the positive local _MATH_ co-ordinate directions. 
For the specific case of _MATH_, Equations (_REF_)-(_REF_) become: _MATHDISP_.

Post-layout emitted pulse in time-domain.
By setting _MATH_ and combining the relations (2-1) and (2-5), we get a new integral representation for fractional exponential equation _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, where the function _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_. 
In view of the theorems of fractional exponential operator expressed in this section, we may apply this operator to PFDEs in next section.
In _CITE_, Templeman et al. applied maximum entropy theory to solve optimization problems in which the objective function is unanimously approximated by a smooth one. 
By solving the resulting problem, an approximate solution of the original problem can be obtained. 
The purpose of deploying maximum entropy theory in agents' search process in our model is to find a probability distribution that both satisfies the known routing information and mostly approximate to the unbiased (uniform) distribution.
With the production of multiply negatively charged clusters new charge states are available and therefore changes of the decay pathways are possible, in particular emission of electrons competing with the evaporation of atoms. 
Furthermore, as shown below, experimental electron affinities can be obtained which will be compared to predicted values.
Our game is particular as we are only interested in actions taken by some particular individuals in the population. 
Indeed, with a given probability _MATH_, a newborn individual does not necessary follow its parents genes and then, it is able to take an action individually (Hawk or Dove). 
Another particular feature of our game is that this decision is based on a fitness which is the same for all individuals (i.e., common to all the population) and is given by the maximum number of offspring. 
Thus, our game with state-dependent action asks an important question: who are the players? 
Is it each newborn individual, since its action is taken in a distributed manner, OR the population itself, since the individual fitness is the overall number of offspring? 
This question is not simple and we provide some elements of answers in section _REF_.
In the case of flat ellipsoids, local pressure and velocity fields are obtained from Eqs. (_REF_) to (_REF_) by replacing _MATH_ by _MATH_. 
That is, _MATHDISP_ is replaced with _MATHDISP_, which is obtained from the consideration of Eq. (_REF_). _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
To select _MATH_ at random, by homogeneity we can just set _MATH_, and then use the normalization of area on _MATH_. 
Denote by _MATH_ the _MATH_-dimensional Hausdorff measure on _MATH_. 
We adopt the convention that _MATH_ is defined via the Euclidean _MATH_ metric, and normalized by the factor _MATH_, so if _MATH_ is a positive natural number, the cube of sidelength 1 has Hausdorff _MATH_ measure 1. 
A consistent choice of normalizing factor is required, for instance, to use Fubini's Theorem, or more generally, the coarea formula. 
We denote by _MATH_ the uniform probability on _MATH_, that is _MATH_, where _MATH_ is chosen so that _MATH_. 
Occasionally, and for simplicity, we will utilize absolute value signs to denote volumes and areas.
: 
Suppose that _MATH_ then _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ we get the inequality _MATHDISP_
Usually, for systems whose dynamics are intrinsic fractal, the graphic representation of _MATH_ will be a line and its slope denotes the value of the fractal dimension.
The brute-force attack against PHP web session IDs we detailed here shows how large botnets can be used to overcome protection based on something being "hard to guess". 
The category includes session IDs, cookies, hidden URLs and passwords. 
For session IDs, the problem can be solved by using sufficient entropy when seeding security-critical pseudo-random number generators. 
For instance, /dev/urandom on Linux generates bits generated from random activity on peripheral devices and drivers. 
PHP supports additional entropy sources for session IDs, but unfortunately disables them by default. 
It is also prudent to expire sessions faster and periodically regenerate IDs used in persistent session cookies.
In contrast, in the threshold scheme, it is not possible to construct an algorithm _MATH_ with the similar guarantee that _MATH_ succeeds almost surely on a random instance in _MATH_, for every subset _MATH_ of density at least _MATH_. 
Indeed, for a given puzzle _MATH_, there may be a subset _MATH_ of density _MATH_ of input instances where no algorithm can succeed with non-negligible probability, while all the other instances outside _MATH_ are easy to solve. 
In this case, there is an algorithm that solves almost all _MATH_-tuples of puzzle instances, if we allow up to about _MATH_ errors. 
However, for any set _MATH_ of density _MATH_ such that _MATH_, no algorithm _MATH_ can succeed on more than _MATH_ fraction of elements of _MATH_.
Take a cylindrically symmetric and twice continuously differentiable potential in _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
It is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is cylindrically symmetric with a minimum at _MATH_ and a maximum at _MATH_ the heteroclinic orbits of _MATH_ are obtained by rotation of the family of the heteroclinic orbits of the corresponding potential _MATHDISP_ around the _MATH_-axis. 
Let us pick one such orbit shown in Fig. _REF_(a). 
Let _MATH_ be a unit speed parametrization of this curve with _MATH_ at its midpoint. 
Set _MATH_. 
Now consider a path in _MATH_ lying on the surface of revolution of the curve _MATH_ and given by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is to be determined as follows. 
Since the path rotates with the given constant angular velocity _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the angle between the tangent vector to the curve at the point _MATH_ and the gradient of the potential at this point (Fig. _REF_(b)). 
Then _MATH_ is found from _MATHDISP_. 
Note that since _MATH_ vanishes linearly at each endpoint, _MATH_ as _MATH_ approaches the ends of its interval of definition. 
This means that the path performs an infinite number of revolutions as it approaches the critical points (Fig. _REF_(b)).
Our data set is composed of one meter resolution panchromatic and the corresponding four meter resolution multispectral Ikonos satellite images of North American regions. 
Table _REF_ lists all of the images forming this data set. 
These test images are labeled by authors. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a labeled data set by experts. 
Therefore, our results may not represent the ideal classification results. 
However, our labeling of the data set is consistent and true to the best of our knowledge. 
As for problems on labeling, some windows straddle transitions from developed to undeveloped areas, and some others encompass lightly developed regions, parkland, and other types of terrain that are hard to classify, even manually.
On the other hand, as was suggested in the 3DGMG _CITE_, (_REF_) includes two mass parameters _MATH_ and _MATH_ implicitly. 
In order to obtain two massive equations from (_REF_), we introduce the four one-dimensional operators, _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_. 
Using these mutually commuting operators, (_REF_) and (_REF_) can be expressed compactly as _MATHDISP_. 
In deriving this, we assume _MATH_constant for simplicity. 
Comparing Eq. (_REF_) with Eq. (_REF_), we find _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_, being the Chern-Simons gravity _CITE_, we have a third-order linearized equation from Eq. (_REF_) instead of the fourth-order equation (_REF_). 
In this case, a single mass parameter _MATH_ is given by either _MATHDISP_.
As in _CITE_, we introduce two other types of utility functions. 
The first one is the power utility, defined for all _MATH_ by _MATH_ (_MATH_ being fixed, we write _MATH_ instead of _MATH_). 
The second one is the logarithmic utility, given by _MATH_.
We analyze a universe filled with interacting dark matter, a scalar field accommodated as dark radiation along with dark energy plus a decoupled radiation term within framework of spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime. 
We work in a 3-dimensional internal space spanned by the interaction vector and use a transversal interaction _MATH_ for solving the source equation in order to find all the interacting component energy densities. 
We asymptotically reconstruct the scalar field and potential from an early radiation era to the late dominate dark energy one, passing through an intermediate epoch dominated by dark matter. 
We apply the _MATH_ method to the updated observational Hubble data for constraining the cosmic parameters, contrast with the Union 2 sample of supernovae, and analyze the amount of dark energy in the radiation era. 
It turns out that our model fulfills the severe bound of _MATH_ at _MATH_ level, is consistent with the recent analysis that includes cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope along with the future constraints achievable by Planck and CMBPol experiments, and satisfies the stringent bound _MATH_ at _MATH_ level in the big bang nucleosynthesis epoch.
Chromospheric standing waves are observed in all four simulation cases that we analysed here. 
These standing waves are more pronounced in the non-magnetic case. 
In the MHD computations, a part of the driver's energy is found to be carried upwards by the slow magnetoacoustic mode, thus reducing the amplitude of the fast magnetoacoustic mode, responsible for the formation of standing wave pattern.
There exist several baseline or kernel radiation models for calculating the incoming radiation in global areas represented by DEMs that fit in the main memory of single processor desktops. 
However, very few derived GIS-tools respond to the applications enumerated previously due to the high computational cost of the used kernel models. 
For instance, baseline models such as Solar Spatial Analyst tool implemented under the commercial ArcGIS 10 _CITE_ and r.sun _CITE_ implemented under GRASS GIS environment _CITE_ calculate the clear-sky global irradiation maps considering the shadowing of the local terrain (i.e., produced by the DEM itself). 
Nevertheless, due to the computational limitations of the used shadow and radiation methods, both models can be applied only to small and medium DEM sizes.
The solar wind speed is also an essential parameter in models of the interplanetary shock propagation like STOA or ISPM (for an overview see, e.g., Dryer et al., _CITE_; Smith, Dryer, and Fry et al., _CITE_, and references therein). 
Predictions of these models could be possibly improved by employing the forecasted solar wind speed instead of that measured at 1 AU at the time when the disturbance was launched.
A self-financing trading strategy is determined by its initial capital _MATH_ and the amount of money _MATH_ invested in the stock, at time _MATH_. 
The wealth at time _MATH_ associated with a strategy _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_. 
We consider a contingent claim, that is a random payoff at time _MATH_ described by a _MATH_-measurable random variable _MATH_. 
We suppose that _MATH_ is bounded and satisfies _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is _MATH_-measurable and _MATH_ is _MATH_-measurable for each _MATH_. 
Then, we define _MATHDISP_, the maximal expected utility that we can achieve by starting at time 0 with the initial capital _MATH_, using some admissible strategy _MATH_ (which is defined throughout the sequel) on _MATH_ and paying _MATH_ at time _MATH_. 
_MATH_ is a given positive constant which can be seen as a coefficient of absolute risk aversion.
The function _MATH_ might have different shapes and in order to allow more freedom in choosing it, we cannot suppose a prior that _MATH_ is an excessive function. 
Also, it might be difficult to check its excessiveness using the infinitesimal generator _MATH_, i.e., _MATH_ satisfies the condition _MATHDISP_. 
Even worse, it could happen that _MATH_.
Soundararajan joined the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1991 for undergraduate studies, and graduated with highest honours in 1995. 
He has made brilliant contributions to several areas of analytic number theory, that include multiplicative number theory, the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions, and more recently with the analytic theory of automorphic forms and the Katz-Sarnak theory of symmetric groups associated with automorphic forms. 
As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Soundararajan made two significant contributions. 
First in joint work with R. Balasubramanian, he proved a famous conjecture of Ron Graham in combinatorial number theory. 
Next he obtained fundamental results on the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. 
For his undergraduate research he was awarded the Morgan Prize of the American Mathematical Society in 1995, the very first year this prize was instituted.
Similar to the ordinary PCA and the centroid method of computing the principal component loadings, successive Maxbet principal component loadings are computed by deflating the _MATH_ matrix in the following way: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Note that the _MATH_, because _MATH_ following (2); so we can compute _MATH_ components.
A lag dominant system is a system in which its time delay is much smaller that its time constant, _MATH_, and thus time delay is not dominant over the system response. 
In this case, tuning the integral time _MATH_ by using (_REF_) gives a base compensator with a small integral term, and thus it can be expected that the reset action does not improve the linear response. 
On the other hand, that choice results in a long settling time for input load disturbances. 
To improve the load disturbance response, a modification of the IMC method proposed by Skogestad will be used here, where _MATH_ is tuned by the rule (_CITE_): _MATHDISP_
Figure 5 shows that the tumor growth is to some extent sensitive to the inhibitor parameter _MATH_, and implies that controlling mutation may improve the effect of TAB treatment or delay a tumor relapse.
From Eqs. (3.32) and (3.37), we have _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATHDISP_, it is seen that _MATH_ is the asymptotic approximation of _MATH_. 
We write _MATHDISP_. 
By using Eqs. (3.38)_MATH_(3.40), it follows that _MATHDISP_. 
With Eq. (3.41), it is obtained readily. _MATHDISP_. 
Considering the following relations, _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, it is obtained readily. _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_.
In contrast, the right graph of Fig. _REF_ provides the dynamics for a single realization of (_REF_). 
We can see that stochasticity plays an essential role in (_REF_) because the left and right graphs represent very different dynamics. 
Our work explains the stochasticity seen in the right graph. 
The variant _MATH_ dominates _MATH_ because of a relatively high pop value, i.e. due to stochastic effects. 
Biologically, the stochasticity of pop values come from the stochasticity of mutation times. 
Critically, this stochasticity depends not on the existence of few infected cells, but rather on the relationship between mutation rates and population sizes. 
For example, the AR regime (see Table _REF_) assumes a population size of _MATH_, yet the dynamics of (_REF_) are still stochastic. 
Similarly, the MPR regime, which based on current experimental results is likely to be a regime appropriate to HIV, shows similar stochastic behavior with a population size _MATH_.
From the Taylor expansion for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
Then, we get a linear combination of the terms of the form _MATHDISP_. 
(In this proof we say the above term is of order _MATH_.) 
Recall that the definition of _MATH_ is the sum of terms of order _MATH_ in the right hand side of (_REF_).
We already mentioned the workload process _MATH_, the set-up time _MATH_ and the idle period _MATH_ of the finite G/M/1 queue. 
Whenever it is important to distinguish the successive idle periods, we write _MATH_ for the first, second, and the subsequent idle periods, otherwise we use a generic random variable _MATH_. 
Note that _MATH_ form an i.i.d. sequence of random variables.
In view of the negative complexity results for our problems there are two major directions to proceed: providing (good) lower bounds on the minimum stabbing number in order to obtain approximation algorithms; and insisting on optimality despite _MATH_-hardness. 
Our (integer) linear programming approach is an elegant way to combine both issues. 
We deal with them in the next two sections.
Cosmic ray particles are charged and so they react strongly to magnetic fields; this was already used very early to estimate the strength of the then unmeasured magnetic fields in interstellar space (Biermann &amp; Schluter 1951); the numbers determined then still hold (Beck et al. 1996). 
It was also realized that cosmic ray particles can get reflected as they spiral along magnetic flux tubes that narrow as they approach a magnetic pole structure. 
Such reflections were then used in almost all cosmic ray acceleration models from Fermi (1949, 1954) on.
Since the Lorentz invariance is broken at finite temperature, the mass _MATH_ and width _MATH_ related to the quark potential are in general different from the dynamic meson mass _MATH_ and the corresponding width _MATH_ controlled by the pole equation _CITE_ _MATHDISP_. 
Only in the vacuum with _MATH_, the two poles coincide.
The basic idea to remove the phase noise of the USOs is to measure it and send this information to Earth where the phase noise can be cancelled from the measurement data in post processing. 
Measuring the USO phase noise locally is impossible in the current baseline design. 
Therefore an inter-spacecraft clock tone transfer scheme was proposed.
This chapter has limited itself to scraping the surface of a thriving area. 
Recent work suggests that peer-to-peer protocols may also be useful in building scalable publish-subscribe systems, improving the reliability of very large "chat" systems, in managing caches for large Web sites and Web Service applications, and in increasing the robustness of mobile, wireless computing platforms, which often suffer from brief disconnections and other disruptive outages. 
One very exciting piece of work, by Ion Stoica at Berkeley, proposes to replace the entire Internet with an architecture (called the Internet Indirection Infrastructure, or I3) in which a DHT is used to deliver packets, substituting this for the traditional Internet routing mechanism. 
Stoica shows that his scheme is able to accommodate such functions as multicast and anycast efficiently, can implement various kinds of packet transformations and pipeline processing, and is even able to provide mobile packet routing under conditions where the standard Internet incurs high overhead.
Consequently, the sketch _MATH_ will have an atomic arrow (in Definition _REF_), _MATH_, which for a R-algebra _MATH_ will have the information flux _MATH_ and hence _MATH_ is (from Theorem _REF_) an atomic morphism in _MATH_.
Task 1 is fulfilled with the hand parsing algorithm. 
Tasks 2 and 3 are fulfilled with the hand detector and global motion estimator, and the 3D fingertip localization algorithm and IK solver respectively.
The financial market consists of a savings account _MATH_ and a risky asset _MATH_, and trading is restricted to finitely many time points. 
Hence, the stock price process is _MATH_, _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the maturity date or total number of allowed trades. 
By discounting, we normalize to _MATH_. 
Furthermore, we normalize the initial stock price _MATH_ to 1 as well. 
Then the set _MATH_ of all possible price processes is simply the set of all vectors _MATH_ which satisfy _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We let _MATH_ be the canonical process given by _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
We write _MATH_ or _MATH_ for the elements of _MATH_, depending on the context; _MATH_ is used for a function on the space, _MATH_ for the stock price process. 
Let us emphasize that we make no other assumptions on our financial market. 
In particular, we do not assume any probabilistic structure.
Part I describes the core of the projector based DAE analysis: the construction of admissible matrix function sequences associated by admissible projector functions and the notion of regularity regions.
Assume there exist positive definite matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, matrices _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ for every _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Then the trivial solution of system (_REF_) with _MATH_ is asymptotically stable for any time-delay _MATH_ satisfying _MATH_. 
Let _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_.
If _MATH_ is _MATH_-majority selective, the stated _MATH_ bound follows from Lemma _REF_ combined with Equation _REF_. 
In this case _MATH_ consists of _MATH_ randomly selected _MATH_-sets, each with cardinality less than _MATH_. 
After noting that Equation _REF_ still holds if _MATH_, we can see that _MATHDISP_. 
The theorem follows. 
Given _MATH_ for all _MATH_, and _MATH_, there is _MATH_ such that for all _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We prove the lemma by contradiction. 
Suppose that there exist _MATH_ and _MATH_ for every _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Taking _MATH_, we have _MATH_, for every _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Hence _MATH_ is a bounded sequence, and we may suppose, without loss of generality, that _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
Furthermore, _MATH_ for every _MATH_ since _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
This shows that _MATH_. 
On the other hand, by the compactness of embedding _MATH_, we conclude that _MATH_. 
This proves the lemma.
Using (_REF_) we can formulate a maxmin control model in the sense of Sect. 3, in which: _MATH_ _MATH_ for each _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ for any Borel set _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_.
The notions of separability and entanglement are currently used as above in order to describe correlation of two states. 
In some cases these notions do not properly represent the correlation in both classical and quantum systems. 
For instance, the correlation in a separable state can be stronger than that of an entangled state. 
Although we follow conventional terminologies in this book, we will give comments related to the above facts in a few other places too.
In this section we present a numerical analysis of all 28 decay channels ("xy"). 
In the various figures we show the decay width and its relative correction at the tree-level ("tree") and at the one-loop level ("full"), _MATHDISP_. 
The total decay width is defined as the sum of the 24 decay widths , _MATHDISP_. 
We also show the absolute and relative changes of the branching ratios, _MATHDISP_. 
The last quantity is crucial to analyze the impact of the one-loop corrections on the phenomenology at the LHC.
In an environment that contained two regions in which nest sites were abundant but of varying quality such that one region contained more high-quality sites, A. florea-like swarms were much faster in making a decision. 
Even though they did not choose a specific site, the flight direction chosen by the majority of the swarms (i.e., _MATH_) pointed towards the nesting region containing the greatest number of good sites. 
In contrast, A. mellifera-like swarms had to decide on a single location and were slower in making a decision. 
The majority of the swarms were not able to decide on a nest site in the given time frame of 10 hours. 
However, when they did make a decision within the time limit, our A. mellifera-like swarms almost always chose one of the best quality sites available.
Proof of Lemma _REF_: 
The proof is by contradiction. 
First observe that because the solution to the perturbed static planning problem must satisfy constraint (_REF_), _MATHDISP_, because _MATH_ by assumption. 
Therefore, if the limit _MATHDISP_ fails to hold, there must exist an index _MATH_, a subsequence _MATH_ and a constant _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_. 
Consider the alternative perturbation with _MATH_ substituted for _MATH_, that is _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Inequality (_REF_) guarantees that for all _MATH_, the solution to the perturbed static planning problem with perturbation _MATH_ is also a solution to the perturbed static planning problem with perturbation _MATH_, and so _MATHDISP_. 
From Assumption _REF_, _MATHDISP_ as _MATH_. 
But Assumption _REF_ also tells us that _MATHDISP_, which contradicts (_REF_). 
The results obtained in the simulations carried out in Section _REF_ as well as the analysis of the real data sets in Section _REF_ cause us to be optimistic about its capability to discover the existence of influence of factors, interactions, covariables, ... the only limitation being the existence or not of one-dimensional methods able to handle the model under consideration.
We select a set of _MATH_ affinely independent points, and partition them into groups _MATH_ so that groups _MATH_ contain _MATH_ points each, and _MATH_ contains between 1 and _MATH_ points. 
Thus it must be that _MATH_.
To avoid a full OEO conversion of every data signal for electronic processing, another approach suggests a sender first to transmit an optical signal along a dedicated light path to set a light path for data transmission. 
The data will then be sent subsequently in a _MATH_ time after the path setup signal has been sent out. 
As illustrated in Fig. _REF_, upon arriving at a relaying unit, the path setup signal is converted into electrical signal, which is processed electronically to set up a light path for the data transmission. 
In this case, no OEO conversion is carried out for data signal, which does travel in the optical domain all the way down to the destination. 
Such a typical example is called optical burst switching (OBS) _CITE_.
While a comprehensive description of all possible attacks that can be carried out against a financial institution by abusing its IT infrastructure is beyond the scope of this book, in this chapter we focus on five different attack strategies: Man-in-the-Middle (Section _REF_), portscan activities (Section _REF_), distributed denial of service (Section _REF_), session hijacking (Section _REF_) and malware-based attacks against financial institution's customers (Section _REF_).
Color Table A color palette, that can be local (valid only for the image immediately following it) or global (valid for all images that do not have a local one). 
Both kinds have the same structure, that consists of a sequence of _MATH_ bytes representing RGB color triplets.
In the absence of DNA looping, the parametric representation of the curve becomes _MATHDISP_. 
It follows that the bifurcation curve exists (i.e. lies in the positive octant of the _MATH_-space) for all _MATH_.
In this section, we want to study the asymptotic behavior of the Casimir force when _MATH_ pairs of the transversal plates are large, i.e., _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
More precisely, we are going to derive the limit _MATHDISP_, which we call the Casimir force density. 
We consider the low temperature expansion and high temperature expansion separately. 
The computations are similar as in the previous sections. 
We only write down the final answers. 
Details can be found in the preprint version of this paper posted in the arXiv _CITE_.
The methods to solve the impact problem in multibody systems composed of rigid bodies, can be divided in two families _CITE_: the discontinuous and the continuous approaches. 
The rigid body assumption made here, means that the bodies are supposed to be hard and only very small local deformations are required to generate very large contact pressures _CITE_. 
The discontinuous approaches assume that the impact occurs instantaneously and changes the momenta balances of the system instantaneously, see e.g. _CITE_. 
In _CITE_ the impact is considered also discontinuous, but a fast time scale which considers the duration of the contact and the flexibility of the colliding bodies, is used to compute the coefficient of restitution to feed back the multibody system equations. 
On the other hand the continuous approaches are based on regularized force models that relate the force and deformation of the bodies in collision _CITE_, or based on unilateral constraints techniques that avoid the penetration between bodies _CITE_. 
In applications in which it is expected to occur permanent contacts or at least contacts of a significant duration, continuous methods are needed. 
Inside the continuous methods based on regularized forces, there are a number of viscoelastic and viscoplastic models in the bibliography (see e.g. _CITE_).
The existence and uniqueness of solution of Langevin equation involving two fractional orders in different intervals (_MATH_) have been studied in _CITE_, and for other choices of _MATH_ and _MATH_, see, _CITE_.
On the other hand, the expansion of the source region, i.e., the impulsively heated parts of flare loops, very soon becomes suppressed by the associated magnetic field changes. 
Since we assume that the magnetic field, _MATH_ is homogeneous initially (Fig. _REF_, left), and bearing in mind the "frozen-in" condition and the magnetic flux conservation, the magnetic field within the expanding source-region volume should decrease as _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the coordinate of the source-region boundary (so called contact surface). 
Furthermore, the magnetic pressure increases in front of the source region due to the wave-associated compression caused by the contact-surface motion. 
Thus, the resulting magnetic pressure gradient can be estimated as _MATH_, where the wave-associated compression _MATH_ is a function of the contact-surface velocity and the coronal plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio _MATH_.
In pervasive applications, frequent node churn leads to the change in network topology. 
Therefore, the shortcut structure must be adapted dynamically. 
The adaptation in the underlying overlay is discussed in Section _REF_, and thus this section will concentrate on the adaptation in the shortcut structure.
It can be seen, that imbalance of positive and negative fluxes proved to be even higher than for strong magnetic fields (Figures _REF_ and _REF_). 
This is true both for the northern and southern hemispheres. 
As pointed out by _CITE_, magnetic flux from decaying sunspots moves toward the poles, predominantly from the following spots. 
This may lead to a deficit of the following polarity in the sunspot zone and produce the observed imbalance.
3) When _MATH_, the system is in a hyperchaotic state
-If there is no a motion in the current frame (i.e the size of the computed motion mask goes to zero) and the proposed algorithm converge to the same position as in the previous frame, so the target is in stationary state and the rectangular patch in the current frame remains the same.
The ROI of the analyzed magnetograms was defined as the set of those pixels in each subarray whose LOS magnetic flux is larger than the image noise level. 
Following _CITE_, this was estimated as _MATH_ 3 times the standard deviation of quiet sun (defined as those pixels whose magnetic flux is smaller than 100 G) magnetic flux distribution in the data. 
The obtained threshold values are 41 G for MDI sub-arrays, and 25 G and 20 G for the 45 s and longer cadence HMI data, respectively. 
These values are consistent both with threshold values employed in previous studies of fractal measurements in flaring regions, as well as with previous estimates of noise levels on MDI and HMI data. 
Details are provided in the following (Section _REF_).
The event _MATHDISP_ is included in essentially the same event _MATHDISP_ then _REF_ reads as _MATHDISP_ and the next form is used for the computations in the paper: _MATHDISP_.
Lemmas _REF_ and _REF_ proved for the linear escape graph apply to the full escape graph with almost identical proofs. 
Lemma _REF_ requires modification. 
Recalling the notation of section _REF_, consider _MATH_ lineages, _MATH_ for _MATH_, sampled at _MATH_ and assume _MATH_. 
Decompose _MATH_ by, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ corresponds to _MATH_ variants at _MATH_ that descend from a _MATH_ mutation. 
From the discussion following (_REF_) we have, _MATHDISP_
For every node _MATH_, define _MATH_. 
There exists an integer number _MATH_ such that the following is true w.h.p.. _MATHDISP_.
All successful applications of model checking thus far have made use of domain specification abstraction techniques. 
Continuing this trend and drawing inspiration from recent work like environment abstraction _CITE_, we exploit the domain knowledge about parameterized systems to devise an appropriate abstraction method. 
We propose a novel generic approach called two-dimension abstraction (TDA), which could effectively reduce the state space of parameterized systems. 
In our work, the size of the state transition graph for each process is reduced independently at first, then the whole system composed of the reduced processes is abstracted based on the design principles of parameterized systems, thus avoiding the construction of the complete state space that might be too large to fit into memory.
So configurations are signed objects, to which a certain content is attached, and we can view the objects involved in Theorem _REF_ as special subclases of permutations, as we now show.
It is well known that there exists a unique globally asymptotically stable steady state and we will denote it by _MATH_. 
In other words, no matter what the initial value _MATH_ is, the solution _MATH_ converges to _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
Furthermore, it is also well known that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ (see _CITE_).
As an elementary application of the parameterization method, we give a general scheme for computing connecting orbits associated with homoclinic tangles in _MATH_ (the scheme generalizes for homoclinic tangles in _MATH_ in an obvious way). 
We note that a similar technique for computing heteroclinic arcs in _MATH_ is given and implemented in _CITE_. 
Software for the scheme developed in this section has been implemented in MatLab, and is used in Section _REF_ to study connecting dynamics in the vortex-bubble of the Lomeli map.
In the last step models are selected which have the chiral matter content of the MSSM, i.e. three generations of quarks and leptons. 
Additionally, the models are allowed to have vector-like exotics. 
In order for some exotics to be vector-like they either have to form real representations or they have to come in pairs of some representations plus their complex conjugates. 
Then, it is in principle possible to write down a mass term for these exotics with a very high mass such that the exotics decouple from the low energy effective theory. 
Note, however, that the couplings in the superpotential relevant for the mass terms cannot be put in by hand, but they have to be derived from string theory, as discussed in section _REF_. 
It turns out that in these models almost _MATH_ has the MSSM spectrum plus vector-like exotics (table _REF_).
Another important notion is partial correlation. 
If _MATH_ denotes the best linear prediction of _MATH_ given _MATH_ and _MATH_ the best linear prediction of _MATH_ given _MATH_, then the partial correlation (pacf) at lag _MATH_ is defined as _MATH_ and turns out to be equal to the coefficient of _MATH_ in the forecast of _MATH_, i.e. _MATHDISP_. 
The coefficients of _MATH_ can be calculated recursively, for instance by the Durbin-Levinson algorithm (see Brockwell and Davis 1991). 
The coefficients _MATH_ for _MATH_ can then be obtained recursively by repeated conditioning and insertion of corresponding one-step forecasts.
Lemma 2.3 Let _MATH_ be a ball, _MATH_ be a ring, _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_, _MATH_ there exists a constant _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Similar inequalities hold for the fractional derivative _MATH_.
We consider allocation problems with indivisible goods when agents' preferences are single-peaked. 
We propose natural rules (called up methods) to solve such a class of problems, and axiomatically characterize them. 
We also prove that these methods can be interpreted as extensions to the indivisible case of the so-called equal distance rule.
LSL provides a shorthand for writing traits in-line. 
Three such examples are enumerations, tuples, and union. 
The trait Flavor shown in Figure _REF_ defines three distinct constants, and an operator to enumerate them. 
This trait can be succintly defined as
The stochasticity of the pop values has significant impact on the dynamics of (_REF_). 
The left graph of Fig. _REF_ gives a solution for the deterministic analogue of (_REF_) in which stochastic events are replaced by their average. 
Another way to describe such a system is as (_REF_) when all pop values are equal. 
Either way, since our equations are symmetric, the dynamics must be symmetric and this is indeed the case in left graph. 
All variants within the same variant class have identical dynamics.
(i) There exist constants _MATH_ such that for any _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the distance between _MATH_ and _MATH_ on the the torus _MATH_. 
In particular for _MATH_ we can choose _MATH_.
Even-though the effective theory is defined in the doubled space with coordinates _MATH_ and _MATH_, these are related by the self-duality constraint (_REF_). 
So, to obtain the equations of motion, we will vary the action with respect to the independent variable _MATH_. 
They contain the non-local part which is gained by varying with respect to _MATH_. 
The form of non-local term is a consequence of the relation _MATH_, which follows from (_REF_).
Here _MATH_, _MATH_ is the initial bending stiffness (_MATH_), _MATH_ is the bending stiffness at final failure time _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the bending stiffness at any instant of time _MATH_. 
The same model fits the flap and lag bending stiffness since degradation effects the normalized flap and lag stiffness in similar manner.
By Schur complement _CITE_, we know that _MATH_ is equivalent to (_REF_). 
Using similar method as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 it can be obtained that the system (_REF_) is globally robustly exponentially stable in the mean square. 
This completes the proof.
Recent results at the LHC indicate a Higgs mass of roughly 126 GeV _CITE_ which is near the upper end of the range allowed in simple and commonly studied models such as the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) _CITE_ and indeed has put pressure on these models pushing the mass scales associated with supersymmetry breaking parameters to higher values _CITE_. 
Furthermore, the absence of supersymmetric particles at the LHC _CITE_ also point to higher mass scales _CITE_. 
While successful phenomenologies can still be constructed for the CMSSM _CITE_, the data seems to point beyond the CMSSM _CITE_.
For example, it could be interesting to compare with other alternative proposals where stellar solutions are derived. 
In view of this, we consider, for instance, the results reported in _CITE_ in which the hydrostatic equilibrium and stellar structure in _MATH_ gravity has been studied. 
As well enlighted in _CITE_ the strong gravity regime is a valuable way to check the validity of the extended and the multidimensional theories of gravity, in particular the formation and the evolution of stars can be considered suitable test for these theories.
The fs-structured regions of PMMA appears gray (see, the close up in Fig. _REF_(b)) and one could expect carbonization _CITE_ taking place under highly non-equilibrium thermal conditions at the irradiation sites. 
However, carbonization usually recognized by Raman signature at 1580 cm_MATH_ _CITE_ was not detected from laser structured regions. 
Even the regions 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. _REF_) which had a larger density of irradiation sites with lateral periods in the y (and x) directions: 0.5(and 2.5), 2.0(2.5), and 2.0(2.5) _MATH_m, respectively, showed no detectable Raman mark. 
The color appearance can be related to the change of nano-structure of PMMA and absorption of laser-induced defects.
In the coming section, we shall prove existence and uniqueness of the weak solutions to (1.3). 
A _MATH_-valued _MATH_-adapted process _MATH_ is called a weak solution of (1.3) with an initial value _MATH_, if it fulfills the following two conditions:
Theorem 2.1 In _MATH_, system _MATH_ has the equilibria _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATH_ is a saddle point, _MATH_ is a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium. 
Besides _MATH_ and _MATH_, (i) when _MATH_, system _MATH_ has two boundary equilibria _MATH_, _MATH_ is unstable; _MATH_ is locally asymptotically stable if _MATH_ and _MATH_, and unstable if _MATH_ or _MATH_.

- Euclidean Topology. 
We briefly recall some basics of the Euclidean topology. 
Consider the Euclidean metric _MATH_ in _MATH_-dimensional (nD) Euclidean space _MATH_ (_MATH_ is sufficient for our purpose). 
Let _MATH_. 
The set _MATHDISP_ is the (open) _MATH_-neighbourhood of _MATH_, also called the (open) _MATH_-ball centred at _MATH_, or unit ball if _MATH_.
The control parameter _MATH_ determines the strategy of an individual. 
This parameter represents the probability for an individual to play Hawk in the highest state. 
We define by _MATH_ the reward of an individual playing action _MATH_ against the population profile _MATH_ (it means that _MATH_ is the proportion of Hawks in the population). 
Then we have _MATHDISP_. 
Each individual wants to maximize its expected time spent in state 2, as it is highly related to the average number of offspring of an individual. 
We denote by _MATH_ the state of a tagged individual at time _MATH_. 
The fitness of this individual taking action _MATH_ is expressed by: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Since the expected number of births per individual is proportional to the time it spends in state 2, the fitness as we defined it, has the direct meaning of expected number of offspring of an individual.
One can release the assumption of compactness of the set _MATH_ assuming (D) and:
SAPDS is designed with the consideration that every request executed on the cloud server cost money. 
Having massive computation capacity does not mean that we can delegate every task to the cloud server. 
At the same time we do not want to escalate the processing load on the owner or on the user as well, to avoid the situation where migrating to cloud does not seem to be a lucrative option. 
Table _REF_ summaries the computation complexity SAPDS for each involved entities.
Until now, only little effort has been devoted to FD of NCSs, unlike a lot of literatures about modelling and control for such kind of systems. 
Some new ideas and results on FD of NCS, including the fundamentals of FD for NCS with information-scheduling, FD approaches based on the simplified time-delay system models are summarised in _CITE_. 
In _CITE_, the NCS is represented by a T-S fuzzy model, based on such mode, a parity-equation approach and a fuzzy-observer-based approach for fault detection are developed. 
A fault detection method for discrete-time model NCS is proposed in _CITE_. 
In _CITE_, the robust fault detection problem is investigated for NCS modelled by Markovian jump systems. 
Note that most of these works are focused on the fault detection for linear NCS, little attempt has been made on the FE problem for linear and nonlinear NCS.
In order to limit the number of simultaneously activated local controllers, it is useful to use a two-stage interpolation function. 
The role of the first stage is to determine the index of the most representative local model in accordance with the domain where the system evolves. 
The model index thus obtained is a real number which lie in the interval _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the number of local models. 
In the second stage, this model index is used to elaborate an appropriate combination of the corresponding local controllers. 
Formally, the two-stage interpolation function of the controller _MATH_, is obtained by composition of two functions, namely _MATH_ and _MATH_, i.e., _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ 
The functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are designed so that _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_ 
Under these conditions, on each local region only two controllers are active. 
More precisely on the domain _MATH_, the controller _MATH_ interacts with:
 the controller _MATH_ when _MATH_, 
 the controller _MATH_ when _MATH_.
The LPML results (_MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_ for _MATH_, _MATH_ for _MATH_, and _MATH_ for _MATH_) suggest that _MATH_ is the most preferable model with the highest LPML value. 
Comparison of each of the 4 submodels with _MATH_ can be visualized as CPO plots (Figure _REF_). 
Clearly, _MATH_ is superior to _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, which supports that there is overdispersion from the temporal random effect and that Hurricane Georges may have changed the spatial random effect.
To see that _MATH_ satisfies (_REF_), using (_REF_)-(_REF_), (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_), we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
This implies the desired result.
5. for the case when _MATH_ is an unary operation _ DISJOINT _MATH_ FROM _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_, the logical formula _MATH_ is equal to the SOtgd: _MATH_.
Let us consider the scalar _MATH_-periodic boundary value problem _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_ , _MATH_. 
It is easy to check that the function _MATHDISP_, is a solution of problem _REF__REF_
his solution has values in the domain _MATHDISP_ , where, as one can verify, the convergence condition _REF_is not satisfied. 
However, the corresponding condition with the doubled constant _REF_ does hold, and, therefore, the interval halving technique can be used.
if _MATH_ is a hook of size _MATH_ and height _MATH_, we define _MATH_ as the ribbon _MATH_ above.
Given a feasible solution _MATH_ to the Partition instance such that _MATH_, we can define a schedule _MATH_ for _MATH_ in the following way: _MATHDISP_, where batch _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Hence, the completion time of agent _MATH_'s jobs does not exceed _MATH_ and the completion time of agent _MATH_'s jobs is _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is a feasible schedule for _MATH_.
In view of Theorem _REF_, we can write _MATH_ instead of _MATH_. 
In the expression _MATHDISP_ the first three terms are the sets of all elements belonging to exactly one of _MATH_ and _MATH_, while the fourth term is the intersection of all three. 
So _MATH_ consists of all those elements which belong to an odd number of the sets _MATH_ and _MATH_; see Figure _REF_, where _MATH_ is represented by the shaded area.
Since _MATH_ is an _MATH_-Brownian motion, we get under (HC) that it remains a _MATH_-Brownian motion. 
Indeed, using (HC), we have that _MATH_ is a _MATH_-local martingale with quadratic variation _MATH_. 
Applying Levy's characterization of Brownian motion (see e.g. Theorem 39 in _CITE_), we obtain that _MATH_ remains a _MATH_-Brownian motion.
Many MOR techniques involve a form of coordinate transformation where the residual is constrained to be orthogonal to the space spanned by the new coordinate system. 
Under this projection framework, the model order reduction problem can be stated as follows: (1) find a new coordinate system that is aligned with some important characteristics of the system (kinetic energy for example) and (2) ensure the orthogonal projection preserves some important dynamical characteristics (stability for example) of the original system. 
For fluid flow problems the first objective is usually satisfied by the the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). 
The POD produces a coordinate transformation that is optimal with respect to the kinetic energy of the fluid flow. 
Satisfying the second objective is usually more difficult. 
For linear dynamical systems a large variety of rigorous, robust and computationally efficient methods are available for preserving important dynamical properties such as stability _CITE_. 
For nonlinear systems on the other hand, very few rigorous methods are available _CITE_. 
As a result, ROMs of fluid flow derived from the standard projection MOR approach are prone to instabilities. 
This is especially true for turbulent fluid flows modeled by the Navier Stokes equation.
A first consequence of the definitions and Eq. _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_ 
This formula allows to compute the integral of _MATH_ as an "ordinary" integral since the integration element is only _MATH_.
In this article we develop a theoretically safe new procedure for the extraction of the pole mass, width and residue of resonances based on the mathematically well defined Pade Theory _CITE_. 
This theory explores the features of convergence of a sequence of rational functions, called Pade Approximants (PA), to the function one wants to investigate. 
In this regard, Pade Theory provides a set of theorems of convergence that allows us not only to propose a model-independent method for extracting resonance properties for such function but also to provide a criterion for the evaluation of the error on the extraction of such resonance parameters. 
In particular, thanks to the Montessus de Ballore theorem _CITE_ we are able to unfold the 2RS of a physical amplitude to search for the position of its resonance pole (if any) in the complex plane.
Plasma contribution to refractive index _MATH_ is negative. 
In air _MATH_ is determined by equation: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ - plasma frequency; _MATH_, _MATH_ - electron charge and mass; _MATH_ - density of free electrons.
Analogously the selected bursts (86 samples) of interval III are also R-strongly polarized. 
The duration is similar as previously: 7.5 _MATH_ 1.7 ms.
On the other hand, by _REF_ with _MATH_ and _REF_ with _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, using the change of variables: _MATH_, we have _MATH_, which combined with _REF_ furnishes _REF_. 
Analogously, we have _MATH_, which completes the proof of Lemma _REF_. 
The assertions for _MATH_ and _MATH_ in Lemma _REF_ immediately follows from the following lemma. 
Let _MATH_ be a multiplier belonging to _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be operators defined by _MATHDISP_. 
Then, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Set _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
As was stated in the proof of Lemma _REF_, the lemma follows from the fact that _MATHDISP_. 
First, we prove that _MATHDISP_. 
By _REF_, _REF_ and the Leibniz rule, we have _MATHDISP_, so that by Theorem 2.2 in Shibata and Shimizu _CITE_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, employing the same argumentation as in the proof of Lemma _REF_, we have _REF_.
Step 1. 
We start by guessing the values and the differences of the elements associated to the lists _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
For this, we will try all the possible combinations of their elements, there are _MATH_ in total. 
For each one of the _MATH_ tries, all the checked cells _MATH_ from _REF_ now have known value and difference. 
From here, 8 bytes are known in each of the four lists _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_: this imposes a 64-bit constraint on those lists, which filter out a single element in each. 
Thereby, we determined the value and difference in the other 16 bytes marked by _MATH_ in _REF_. 
In lists _MATH_ and _MATH_, we have reached the maximum number of independent differences (three and two, respectively), so we can determine the differences for the other bytes of those columns: we mark them by _MATH_. 
In _MATH_, the 8 constraints (three _MATH_ and two _MATH_) filter out one element; then, we deduce the correct element in _MATH_ and mark it by _MATH_. 
We can now determine the differences in _MATH_ since the corresponding subspace has a dimension equals to two. 
See _REF_ for the current situation of the guess-and-determine algorithm.
Let _MATH_ denote the _MATH_-th longest batch, i.e., _MATH_ is the _MATH_-th longest among the processing times of all the batches that we consider.
We see that, qualitatively, the results are the same as in the previous subsection. 
In particular, the oscillation amplitude grows with time, so that cooling amplifies the kink oscillations. 
Quantitatively the effect of cooling is much less pronounced. It is not surprising at all because now cooling affects only the plasma inside the loop. 
We also see that the effect of cooling on the oscillation amplitude increases when _MATH_ decreases. 
Once again it is an expected result because, when _MATH_ decreases, the density of the external plasma is getting less important for the oscillation properties.
We call _MATH_ a standard triangle if and only if _MATH_ with _MATH_ (for example Figure _REF_.b). 
We call _MATH_ a thin triangle if and only if _MATH_ with _MATH_. (for example Figure _REF_.c). 
We call _MATH_ minimal if and only if _MATH_ is not a point and either _MATH_ has 1 interior lattice point or _MATH_ has no interior lattice points.
As we know, the modified Einstein-Hilbert action _CITE_ is, _MATHDISP_, in which _MATH_, _MATH_ is the gravitational constant, _MATH_ is the Ricci scalar, and _MATH_ is the Lagrangian density of matter. 
The Gauss-Bonnet invariant is defined as _MATH_ (_MATH_ and _MATH_ are the Ricci tensor and the Riemann tensor, respectively).
Step 4: Making only partial measurements on the third part on the system in the state _MATH_ means that Bob will control a state _MATH_ on _MATH_ given by the partial trace on _MATH_ of the state _MATH_ (after Alice's measurement) _MATHDISP_.
The above list provides some insight into the limitations of OWL. 
Besides these limitations, we can also observe that in many situations in order to model the domain of an application we need to be able to express complex rules. 
OWL by itself does not provide any rule definition support. 
In the context of Web services, rules are important to enable the formal definition of services functionalities, like "this service can be invoked only if the credit card is valid, and a credit card is valid if it is not expired and its monthly maximum credit amount was not reached". 
To provide rule support for OWL, the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) _CITE_ was defined. 
SWRL is a simple extension of OWL with material (first-order) implication and due to the straightforward way in which the rules are integrated with OWL, it is trivially undecidable (close-world reasoning). 
Furthermore, SWRL cannot address tasks such as integrity constraints, since it was designed as a first-order language.
Consider any collection _MATH_ of translates of _MATH_ and a point set _MATH_. 
The collection _MATH_ covers _MATH_ at least _MATH_ times if and only if _MATH_ contains at least _MATH_ elements of the set _MATH_. 
Therefore a _MATH_-fold covering of _MATH_ transforms into a point set such that for every _MATH_ the set _MATH_ contains at least _MATH_ points of _MATH_. 
The required decomposition of _MATH_ exists if and only if the set _MATH_ can be colored with two colors such that every translate _MATH_ that contains at least _MATH_ elements of _MATH_ contains at least one element of each color. 
Thus constructing a finite system of translates of _MATH_ and a point set where this latter property fails is equivalent to constructing an indecomposable covering using the translates of _MATH_.
Protocol: 
On input _MATH_, _MATH_ invokes _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
On input _MATH_, _MATH_ invokes _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
The execution is described below for a party _MATH_ emulating _MATH_, and is the same for both _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In each round:
The laser altimetres on the Apollo _MATH_-_MATH_ spacecrafts provided lunar topographic data for surface points at a high accuracy of 2 m _CITE_. 
The lunar surface has been globally mapped at a lateral resolution of _MATH_ in longitude and latitude, i.e. better than _MATH_ km, by laser altimetry from the Clementine spacecraft _CITE_. 
According to _CITE_, a global topographic map of the Moon with a standard deviation of the elevation values of _MATH_ m has been constructed using the Laser Altimeter (LALT) instrument on board the Kaguya (SELENE) spacecraft. 
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) carries the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), which provides elevation data with a standard deviation of _MATH_ mm _CITE_. 
The LOLA elevation measurements have been resampled into global topographic maps ("gridded data record") of 4, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ pixels per degree nominal lateral resolution _CITE_. 
With increasing number of elevation measurements, topographic maps of _MATH_ and _MATH_ pixels per degree nominal lateral resolution have also been made available. 
However, in many lunar regions the true lateral resolution of these topographic maps is much lower than the nominal one as they tend to contain a significant number of interpolation artifacts.
Structural dynamical analysis by a lengths based description of the small strains in the finite displacements regime.
All numbers in the list of critical points above are exact. 
The coefficients in the potential (_REF_) have been chosen so that _MATH_ the critical points are nondegenerate and can be found analytically, and _MATH_ there are only seven critical points rather than more.
Assume that the Hypothesis (H2) is valid. 
Then the Dirichlet boundary value problem _REF_ has a unique solution _MATH_ for every _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be an optimal pair to problem _REF_-_REF_. 
Let _MATH_ be the solution of problem _REF_-_REF_ for given _MATH_, _MATH_, and let _MATH_, where _MATH_ takes an arbitrary value in _MATH_. 
Since, by the initial assumptions, _MATH_, it follows that _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_. 
Then Lemma _REF_ implies that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ provided _MATH_. 
By Hardy-Poincare Inequality (see _REF_), the expression _MATHDISP_ can be considered as a scalar product in _MATH_. 
Then, in view of the Riesz Representation Theorem, we conclude the existence of a unique element _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
As a result, we have: _MATH_ is a unique solution to the Dirichlet boundary value problem _REF_. 
Moreover, by Corollary _REF_, we finally get _MATH_.
Proof of correctness. 
We can assume without loss of generality that, after Step 0, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
As argued before, the coordinate system computed in Step (ii) is such that _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are strictly monotonic in the _MATH_-direction. 
Furthermore, in projection onto the _MATH_-plane, _MATH_ has two (identical) asymptotes parallel to the _MATH_-axis, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ both have one asymptote parallel to the _MATH_-axis and another parallel to the _MATH_-axis (by Propositions _REF_, _REF_, _REF_ and from the analysis of one configuration). 
Hence, each of these branches is also strictly monotonic in any direction obtained by a sufficiently small rotation of the _MATH_-axis about the _MATH_-axis in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction (depending on the branch). 
To summarize, the viscoplastic constitutive model is described by the following set of equations: _MATHDISP_. where _REF_ is obtained by substituting Eqs. _REF_, _REF_, _REF_ and _REF_ in Eq. _REF_, with _MATH_ given by _REF_. 
The system of equations in _REF_ can be further simplified by introducing _REF_ into _REF_ and _REF_, leading to: _MATHDISP_.
Also called coupled map lattice (CML), a floating point variation of CA _CITE_ is a technique for the simulation of natural phenomena. 
Instead of using a discreet change of states, like Boolean, CML allows floating numbers as states. 
The truth table remains valid, since a unique threshold is defined. 
Nevertheless, using a derivative of _MATH_ instead of 0 or 1, CML permits intermediate steps (and therefore more natural visual effects) to occur. 
For some common functions, i.e. boiling, convection, reaction-diffusion processes, CML-CA and classical CA both converge to identical states. 
However, CML-CA distorts behaviors locally, then globally. 
While this distortion makes processes more complex, it also offers opportunities to explore new behaviors. 
The test bed presented in this study provides this powerful technique as an option. 
CML can be selected by using non-Boolean step on the user interface (Figure _REF_).
To make the inflation model, at least a semi-realistic one and free from severe fine tune tunings, we turn to the case of the improved effective potential given by (_REF_). 
As we will see, the fine tuning of the parameters as well as that of the initial condition could be reduced. 
However, one might think that this is achieved at the cost of four new terms in the potential with corresponding free parameters. 
This is indeed true; nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that these new correction terms are not inspired by phenomenological considerations but are rigorously derived using the formalism of flux compactification and Gauge/Gravity correspondence.
Let _MATH_ be an _MATH_ Cauchon diagram. 
We say that a sequence _MATHDISP_ is a lacunary sequence with respect to _MATH_ if the following conditions hold: _MATH_; the boxes _MATH_, _MATH_, ..., _MATH_ are white in _MATH_; _MATH_ and _MATH_; 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_, then _MATH_ is a black box in _MATH_; 
Let _MATH_. 
Then:
 either _MATH_ is a black box in _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_,
or _MATH_ is a black box in _MATH_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_;
Galaxies come in many masses and sizes, and it appears from the data, that there is a smallest mass, which is of order _MATH_ (e.g. Gilmore et al. 2007); such galaxies are called dwarf ellipticals, and many think that they represent the original galaxies, the first ever to form. 
In this picture other galaxies grow out of merging the small galaxies. 
There appears to be a clear separation in properties between star clusters and galaxies; star clusters never have any measurable dark matter, small galaxies are dominated by dark matter (Gilmore et al. 2007). 
Star clusters are also usually smaller. 
If we accept this picture, the scale of these small galaxies also represents the smallest scale in large scale structure, which is an indication of the dark matter particle and its property (here momentum) at the time when it was first produced in processes which we do not know. 
Galaxies grow by merging, and then initiate a starburst, a phase of very high temporary star formation (Sanders &amp; Mirabel 1996). 
In such a merger the central one or two black holes also get fed.
All the examples presented in this paper were made on a PC with Duo CPU 1.8GHz and 2GB memory. 
We employed Intel MKL _CITE_ to solve the sparse linear system in our optimization framework (Sect. _REF_) and adopted CVX MATLAB toolbox _CITE_ to obtain the solution to the quadratic programming on foldover free resizing (Sect. _REF_). 
The averaged length of the edges in triangulations is within 15-35 pixels. 
It takes about 50-100ms to solve the global scaling optimization and takes about 2-4 seconds to solve foldover free optimization for an image with resolution of _MATH_. 
In our system, when the user drag to resize the image, only the scaling optimization is performed so that the user can see the resized images in realtime. 
After the user finish the dragging operation, the foldover free optimization is then performed.
The conventional mathematical apparatus used to describe the vacuum state, or vev of currents operators, makes no reference to the scales on which vacuum properties are to be observed; and in this sense, it is here suggested that the conventional description is incomplete. 
Very high frequency (_MATH_) electric field oscillations could be present in the vacuum but could be inobservable in the sense that they could never be able to affect the motion of electron or proton, or any charged particle with mass _MATH_. 
And this is the case for our solution (4.3), involving an _MATH_ GeV. 
But such rapidly oscillating fields could definitely carry energy, and as such define our Vacuum Energy. 
We therefore postulate that _MATH_ need be neither _MATH_-independent nor zero; but rather, that it generates an _MATH_ which is given by the conventional expression : _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the usual, free field, Feynman photon propagator that, for convenience, is defined in the Lorentz gauge _MATH_: _MATHDISP_
The proof is presented in the way closest to the original one accordingly to _CITE_; we only replaced the old notations by the new ones, as well as corrected numerous misprints in formul√¶ (by the way, _CITE_ contains much less misprints). 
In the effort to make it more accessible for the readers, several modern references were also added, but, of course, the old ones are also left. 
These references are marked with an _MATH_ (only in this subsection).
Calculate centroid, diameter and radius of the three clusters determined in the previous exercise.
Since _MATH_ is always positive, the branch _MATH_ of _MATH_ and _MATH_ (see Proposition _REF_) is parameterized by _MATH_ or by _MATH_ (but not by a combination of both). 
Thus, by changing, if needed, the signs of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, we may suppose that _MATH_ is parameterized by _MATH_. 
This implies, by continuity, that the branch _MATH_ is parameterized, in the frame _MATH_, by _MATH_, while the other branches are parameterized by _MATH_ and the position of _MATH_ with respect to the two roots of _MATH_.
Conditions (2) and (3) define an independently scattered random measure. 
Note that we use _MATH_ when we refer to a general Levy basis, and when we have separated out time as one dimension, we talk of Levy bases defined on _MATH_ and we indicate integration with respect to such bases by _MATH_.
Corrections to the MSSM Higgs boson sector have been evaluated in several approaches, see, e.g. Ref. _CITE_. 
The remaining theoretical uncertainty on the light _MATH_-even Higgs boson mass has been estimated to be _MATH_ depending on the parameter region _CITE_. 
The leading and subleading parts of the existing two-loop calculations have been implemented into public codes. 
The program _REF_FeynHiggs _CITE_ is based on results obtained in the Feynman-diagrammatic (FD) approach, while the code _REF_CPsuperH _CITE_ is based on results obtained using the renormalization group (RG) improved effective potential approach _CITE_. 
For the MSSM with real parameters the two codes can differ by a few GeV for the prediction of _MATH_, partly due to formally subleading two-loop corrections that are included only in _REF_FeynHiggs. 
Both codes do not incorporate the subleading two-loop contributions evaluated in Ref. _CITE_, which are not available in a readily usable code format. 
The existing 3-loop corrections evaluated in Refs. _CITE_ are also not included, since they are not available in a format that can be added straight-forwardly to the existing calculations (see, however, Ref. _CITE_).
We analyze this _MATH_ model in the heavy-traffic regime by scaling up the arrival rates while fixing the service-time distributions. 
We consider the two-parameter stochastic process _MATH_, where _MATH_ represents the number of customers in the system at time _MATH_ with elapsed service times less than or equal to _MATH_. 
(As shown in Pang and Whitt (2010), equivalent results can be obtained for the process _MATH_, and thus we only focus on _MATH_ here.) 
We prove a functional weak law of large numbers (FWLLN, Theorem _REF_) and an FCLT (Theorem _REF_) for this process jointly with the departure process from the system. 
The FWLLN limits are simple deterministic two-parameter functions and the FCLT limits are continuous two-parameter Gaussian processes (random fields). 
Propositions _REF_ and _REF_ provide explicit variance formulas for the Gaussian limit processes when the arrival limit process is a Brownian motion (BM). 
Dependence among the service times has no impact upon the fluid limit (the mean), but has a clear impact upon the variances; we study this impact further in Pang and Whitt (2011a, 2011b).
Notice that the maximum number of processors required to compute _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_, which is maximized as _MATH_ when _MATH_. 
Assume that _MATHDISP_. 
For each of _MATH_, there are enough processors, so that the time needed to compute _MATH_ is _MATH_, for all _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, there are not enough processors, and we can only allocate _MATH_ processors to calculate each submatrix of size _MATH_, where _MATH_. 
Thus, the time need to compute _MATH_ is _MATH_ given by Theorem 6. 
The overall parallel time complexity of the recursive method on DMS is _MATHDISP_. 
By using the following fact, namely, _MATHDISP_, and the fact that _MATH_, the above summations can be simplified as _MATHDISP_. 
Compared to matrix multiplication, our computation only introduces a small overhead.
We make the ansatz that the solution of (_REF_) with the initial condition _MATH_ is of the form _MATHDISP_. 
Then, the Poincar_MATH_ map of (_REF_) is _MATHDISP_. 
The functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ satisfy _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
By Lemmas 4,6 and 7, we know that _MATHDISP_. 
Hence, for _MATH_, we may choose _MATH_ sufficiently small such that _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover we can prove that _MATHDISP_.
A common rule for switching between the waypoints is to proceed towards the next waypoint as soon as the position of the system enters inside an acceptance circle enclosing the current waypoint _CITE_. 
In the present work, we propose that the acceptance circle is replaced by an acceptance region composed of an acceptance circle and also the right half plane of a coordinate system with origo in the current waypoint and _MATH_ axis pointing away from the previous waypoint (see illustration in Fig. _REF_). 
With this definition, we are guaranteed that the robot will reach the acceptance region of the current waypoint no matter how the waypoints are defined. 
With only acceptance circles enclosing each waypoint, there would be the risk that the robot misses a waypoint which is placed too close to the previous waypoint, which would make the robot proceed indefinitely along the path away from the waypoint that was missed. 
Note that although the acceptance region is infinitely large, the path following controller presented in Section _REF_ guarantees rapid convergence to the straight path between two waypoints.
In the [11] it is offered to use the polarized electron beam with energy of _MATH_ MeV in order to obtain the polarized positron beam at Jefferson Lab. 
In order to create an absolute polarimeter on the basis of the bremsstrahlung process it is necessary to perform more accurate calculations, however, it seems that the asymmetry _MATH_ %, reached even for the target with _MATH_, can be applied for creating a reliable and inexpensive polarimeter, required for on-line control of the electron beam polarization.
Let _MATH_ be a modular cut of a matroid _MATH_ on a set _MATH_. 
Then there is a unique extension _MATH_of _MATH_ on _MATH_ such that _MATH_ consists of those flats _MATH_ of _MATH_ for which _MATH_ is a flat of _MATH_ having the same rank as _MATH_. 
The following conditions are satisfied for all subsets _MATH_ of _MATH_ _MATHDISP_. 
(_MATH_ and _MATH_ are rank functions of matroids _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively).
One can obtain the entropy of the holographic screen at stretched horizon by counting the likely microstate. 
We can assume that the system has _MATH_ states to be occupied and _MATH_ quantum bits of spacetime have to be distributed among these states. 
Also, we notice that at the condensate state _MATH_. 
Therefore, the number of distinct ways in which the _MATH_ identical and indistinguishable particles (quantum bits of spacetime) can be distributed among the _MATH_ excited states in the thermodynamic limit will be _MATHDISP_ and, therefor, the entropy can be worked out as a function of _MATH_ or equivalently _MATH_ as follows _MATHDISP_, where, _MATH_ are constants. 
The above result is consistent with the known result that a massless scalar filed yields logarithmic corrections to the entropy _CITE_. 
It follows that in a Minkowski space where all quantum bits of spacetime are in the ground state (according to our proposal), the entropy is zero _CITE_. 
In this way, we may obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as its corrections which are somewhat universal in theories of quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity and string theory _CITE_.
To proceed with the discussion, We need to prove the following transversality result. 
Let _MATH_ be a root of Eq. _REF_ such that _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_.
We convert the benchmarks to run with single precision floating-point numbers for two reasons. 
First, since the double precision floating point instructions are partially pipelined on the SPEs, they stall subsequent instruction issues for six cycles. 
Thus, the double precision floating point instructions are seven times slower on the SPEs than the PPE. 
The other reason is that the software cache implemented in the IBM single source compiler is optimized for word-size data _CITE_. 
We found that the code generated by the IBM single source compiler suffers from severe performance degradation, when it irregularly accesses double precision data. 
Since that would make the comparison unfair, we rather cast the data type to single precision floating point.
From the eighth property of _MATH_ we can think of that if the value of each _MATH_ is proper the superposition of all _MATH_ can make the magnitude of the oscillation of Z(v) small enough because the deviations of _MATH_ and _MATH_ in different directions can counteract mostly. 
Then from (2.41) we know that ripples of _MATH_ will be small. 
And from (2.35), the first property of _MATH_ and the sixth properties of _MATH_ we can think of that if the value of each _MATH_ is proper the superposition of all _MATH_ can make _MATH_ to oscillate from 0 to other values with increasing magnitude on the interval _MATH_. 
Then from (2.42) we can get the _MATH_ with the change of the ripples of relative errors being small.
(Weak Average) For a function _MATH_, the function _MATH_ is said to be a weak average on _MATH_ if for each compact set _MATH_ there exists a class-_MATH_ function _MATH_ such that, for all _MATH_: _MATHDISP_.
The derived kernel at layer _MATH_ is defined as usual as _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_.
Once the obstruction is bypassed and the consistent current is obtained, the effective action in the abnormal parity sector gets well defined _CITE_. 
This idea has been successfully implemented in _CITE_ where the method of covariant symbols _CITE_ is used to obtain the covariant current. 
There the leading order term was obtained in two and four dimensions. 
The same approach has been applied (this time using the world-line method instead of covariant symbols) in _CITE_ to compute the next-to-leading order in two dimensions.
Proof. 
Let _MATH_ be a nonoscillatory solution of (_REF_). 
This proof is done only for _MATH_ eventually positive, since the negative case is similar. 
If necessary, increase the value of _MATH_ in Lemma _REF_ so that _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, for all _MATH_. 
Now, we claim that _MATH_ in (_REF_). 
On the contrary, assume that _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is negative, _MATH_ is decreasing and by (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
Note that this inequality also follows from the Taylor expansion of _MATH_ about _MATH_ with reminder of order 2. 
Using (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
From (_REF_), (A2), (A3), and that _MATH_ is increasing, we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Recall that _MATH_ and that _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_ is increasing, _MATH_. 
Then the inequality _MATH_, (_REF_) and (_REF_) imply _MATHDISP_, which contradicts _REF_ and completes the proof.
In this last section we wish to discuss the degree of predictivity of the model. 
It is of particular importance to determine to which extent the model is able to reproduce _MATH_ distributions coming from data not included in the fit or observables other than the ones used in the fit. 
This comparison will eventually pinpoint sectors of the model which may need to be improved. 
The comparison with the _MATH_ or _MATH_ distributions require the reconstruction of the current fragmentation term, which is obtained with the semi-inclusive version of eqs. (_REF_,_REF_,_REF_) where fracture functions are substituted by appropriate products of parton distributions and fragmentation functions. 
Such term has been estimated to leading order by using the parton distributions of Ref. _CITE_ and the fragmentation functions of Ref. _CITE_.
We have proposed a combination of local search algorithms for a timetabling problem and a comprehensive experimental analysis for tuning its parameters. 
Our results confirm the widely-accepted belief that, for stochastic algorithms, statistically principled analyses are particularly crucial and can lead to substantial improvements.
The proof of Lemma _REF_ depends on two preparatory lemmas. 
(Local creation of finite configurations) For each _MATH_ and _MATH_, there exists a finite _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Proof It follows from assumption (_REF_) that there exists a site _MATH_ with _MATH_, and therefore _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is a.s. finite, we can choose a finite but large enough _MATH_ such that (_REF_) holds.
Lemma _REF_ proves that the function _MATH_ given in Definition _REF_ is a phirotope with the correct underlying matroid. 
Definition _REF_ associates to _MATH_ resp. _MATH_ sets of phased sets _MATH_, _MATH_, and Proposition _REF_ shows that _MATH_, _MATH_ is a dual pair of complex circuit signatures. 
As proved in Theorem A, _MATH_ is just _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the circuit set of the complex matroid associated to _MATH_. 
Proposition _REF_ shows that _MATH_.
The main contribution of this article is to add a nonuniform structure to the random dispersal that species increase their motility when food is not enough. 
To obtain such a starvation driven diffusion the authors have employed the thermal diffusion developed in _CITE_ and the corresponding diffusion model obtained is (_REF_), where the motility function _MATH_ is a decreasing function on the satisfaction measure _MATH_. 
From numerical computations we observed that the species that increases its motility when food is insufficient has an advantage in the competition.
Eliminating _MATH_ between _REF_ and _REF_ we obtain an interesting relation between a gyrocevian and its gyrotriangle that is formalized in the following theorem:
The KTH dataset contains six actions. 
They are performed by 25 actors under four different scenarios of illumination, appearance and scale changes. 
In total it contains 598 video sequences. 
KTH video database containing six types of human actions (walking, jogging, running, boxing, hand waving and hand clapping) performed several times by 25 subjects in four different scenarios: outdoors s1, outdoors with scale variation s2, outdoors with different clothes s3 and indoors s4. as illustrated in Fig. _REF_. 
There are _MATH_ video files for each combination of 25 subjects, 6 actions and 4 scenarios. 
All videos were taken over homogeneous backgrounds with a static camera with 25fps frame rate. 
The videos were down-sampled to the spatial resolution of _MATH_ pixels and have a 4 seconds duration in average.
The 'application agent' provides a generic interface for managing application requirements between AETOS and different applications. 
Note that, these requirements are parametrisation settings that make an application work effectively. 
There is one 'application agent' per application instance. 
The set of application requirements, denoted by _MATH_, managed by the 'application agent' are the following:
Also, it is assumed that the error state is in the ball at the _MATH_-th sampling time _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_.
Doman et al. _CITE_ linearized the dynamic equations about hover, thereby reducing them to second-order decoupled equations on the form _MATH_. 
Hence, a single-channel control could be applied on each equation separately. 
The following control law guarantees the desired under-damped response for the state variable _MATH_ with a natural frequency _MATH_ and damping ratio _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the desired/command values for this degree of freedom and its velocity, respectively. 
This control law is applied on all channels (degrees of freedom) except the _MATH_-channel; that is, _MATHDISP_ where the subscript _MATH_ refers to the error in the signal from the desired trajectory. 
Having obtained the commands for these attainable five forces and moments, they augmented them with zero _MATH_. 
Performing a pseudo inverse for _MATH_ in Eq. (_REF_), they obtained the five control inputs. 
These inputs were then passed through a zero-order hold to keep them unchanged during the cycle. 
This is the inner-loop control. 
Additionally, there is an outer loop control that was used to determine the error in the vehicle position and attitude. 
In the outer-loop, they followed the technique of yaw-transfer. 
In this technique, the vehicle first adjusts its heading while hovering to head toward the desired target, and then it transfers in that direction while adjusting its attitude. 
They simulated their designed controller to fly over five way points. 
The controller performed well except for the excessive required displacements from the bob-weight, which exceeded _MATH_. 
In fact, this limitation stimulated their follow-on research _CITE_.
If _MATH_ has NB_MATH_ law, then its Laplace transform is well defined for _MATH_ in a neighborhood of 0 in _MATH_, and is given by _MATHDISP_.
The time-consuming part has been done in the previous step. 
To perform the benchmark, we just load the set of configurations for one object. 
For each object-object distance and intersection volume, respectively, we start the timing, set the transformation matrix of the moving object to all the configurations associated with that distance and perform a collision test for each of them. 
After that, we get a maximum and an average collision detection time for the given distance or intersection volume, respectively.
To this end, recall that _MATH_ is a (counting) measure, to which our projection operators may be applied in the usual way. 
In agreement with _REF_, we write _MATH_, i.e., _MATH_ is the marginal of _MATH_ w.r.t. the sites in _MATH_; and, likewise, for a realisation _MATH_ of _MATH_. 
Again, we also use shorthands such as _MATH_ to denote marginal frequencies (in this case, _MATH_). 
Furthermore, we set _MATH_ for _MATH_.
Now, the proposed friction factor law can be written as _MATHDISP_ Which is equivalent to the standard Katheder law except that the Reynolds number in Katheder law is replaced by Pradhans number in the proposed equation. 
Figure _REF_ shows the comparison between the experimental friction factor and the Pradhans friction factor for all the curves in the temperature range of 4.4 K to 123 K.
Given the combined ordered sample _MATH_ of two independent ordinary right censored samples, the computation of coverage probabilities for tolerance intervals can alternatively be carried out along the following lines. 
First, let us consider the case when _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Then, _MATHDISP_. 
Given _MATH_, we illustrate the calculation for the term _MATHDISP_. 
Using the joint density of _MATH_ [see _CITE_], we have _MATHDISP_. 
Upon substituting this expression in _REF_, we obtain _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes the joint distribution function of the _MATH_-th and _MATH_-th order statistics in a sample of size _MATH_. 
The remaining terms can all be obtained in an analogous manner. 
In particular, for _MATH_, it can be shown that _MATH_. 
Considering cases similar to those in Theorem _REF_ for _MATH_, i.e.,
The Venus flytrap undergoes three distinct states during the process of trapping _CITE_. 
The first state is the fully open state (Fig. _REF_
) where the trap is maximally opened, providing the maximum amount of surface area for trapping. 
The second state is the semi-closed state (Fig. _REF_B&amp;D), which follows immediately after the trigger hairs are activated, and causes the trap to partially close, with the cilia interlocking (Fig. _REF_D). 
This loose interlocking of the cilia allows small prey that are not energetically favorable to escape, while larger more favorable prey are trapped. 
The final state is the fully closed state (Fig. _REF_C&amp;E), which occurs after extensive stimulation from the struggling prey, and leads to tight oppression and recurved bending of the trap-margins _CITE_. 
It is believed that the trap's opening and closing movement involves complex nonlinear dynamics. 
The semi-closed state of the Venus flytrap is of particular interest, as it allows the plant to either proceed further to the fully closed state, or revert back to the open state. 
While several dynamical models for the Venus flytrap have been proposed to describe the transition from open to semi-closed states _CITE_, the transition from semi-closed to other states has been observed _CITE_, but not included into current mathematical models. 
We believe that the semi-closed state is crucial, since if the prey does not move, the flytrap will return to the fully open state; if, instead, the prey struggles, the trap will proceed to the fully closed state. 
Considering that it usually takes 5-7 days for the digestion process to complete, and this process is energetically costly, the trapping of non-nutritious prey would lead to decreased fitness for the plant.
The same (_MATH_ and _MATH_) are simulated using PSpice by domino ladder network as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
These simulated fractional order capacitors are used to evaluate the filter performance.
Figure 3 shows an ecliptic plane cut of the 3-AU diameter heliosphere as viewed from the north. 
In these plots, the orbit of the Earth is shown by a circle and the Earth is located to the right of its orbit (indicated by a _MATH_ symbol). 
These 1-day cadence cuts reveal several outward propagating features as well as co-rotating structures. 
For example, plots _MATH_ to _MATH_ show CME associated structures propagating to the western side of the Sun-Earth line. 
In these images, one can also see a fast moving structure to the East of the Sun-Earth line, which is the interplanetary propagation signature of a possible fast halo CME that erupted from AR#808 on 7 September 2005, at 17:40 UT, in association with an X17 flare event, which also produced a fast drifting Type II radio burst (speed _MATH_1900 kms_MATH_) (refer to event #4 in Table 1). 
Further, a co-rotating structure expanding with time can be seen in images _MATH_ to _MATH_ from behind the Sun ( i.e., _MATH_180_MATH_ away from the Sun-Earth line). 
In these plots, only features in the ecliptic plane are viewed, and it is difficult to follow an individual event in the inner heliosphere. 
However, when the reconstructed data are plotted as a remote observer would view them for different orientations of Sun-Earth line, they reveal the moving structures corresponding to events on the Sun and their interactions in the inner heliosphere.
For any equilibrium _MATH_ of the system with characteristic Eq. _REF_, we always have _MATHDISP_. 
For the equilibrium _MATH_, note that _MATHDISP_. 
Substituting the above into the expressions for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
With extensive algebraic manipulations we get _MATHDISP_.
The minimum Hamming distance between a Boolean function _MATH_ and all affine functions (in the same number of variables as _MATH_) is called the nonlinearity of _MATH_ and denoted by _MATH_. 
This number is not the only nonlinearity parameter of the function-other ones are for instance the algebraic degree and the algebraic immunity-but it has historically received this name, which is standard nowadays.
Finite Horizon Optimal Tracking Control Based on ADP
In particular, _MATH_ for estimating parameters of a conic or quadric will take the form _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a matrix whose entries depend on _MATH_ and _MATH_ (and _MATH_ in three dimensions), while those of _MATH_ depend on _MATH_ and _MATH_ (and _MATH_ in three dimensions) as well as expected values of measured variables (e.g. _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ in 2D), the latter of which are approximated from finite noisy data samples. 
A complete derivation of the process may be found in _CITE_.
In this section we review the fundamentals of semigroup theory and refer the reader to _CITE_, _CITE_ or _CITE_ for proofs.
Following section will present the proposed model for computing any rule of _MATH_ while enabling the visualizations of the corresponding data flow in real-time.
For the duration of this paragraph and Proposition _REF_, assume that _MATH_ is zero or a positive prime number. 
Given two non-negative integers _MATH_ and _MATH_, say that _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
Then there is the following characterization of Borel-fixed ideals; for positive characteristic, it was proved by Pardue _CITE_*Proposition II.4. For details, see _CITE_*Section 15.9.3. 
Let _MATH_ be an infinite field of characteristic _MATH_. 
An ideal _MATH_ of _MATH_ is Borel fixed if and only _MATH_ is a monomial ideal and for all _MATH_ and for all monomial minimal generators _MATH_ of _MATH_, _MATH_ for all _MATH_ where _MATH_ is the largest integer such that _MATH_.
Sine-wave signal: Consider the sine-wave signal _MATH_ with _MATH_. 
Then after substituting this specific function in (_REF_) and applying the goniometric rules: _MATHDISP_ we arrive at the following result _MATHDISP_ which is again a sine function with frequency_MATH_. 
Let us generate the sampled signal _MATH_ on the finite interval _MATH_. 
Using the MATLAB function xcorr, the corresponding sample autocorrelation functionis calculated. 
See Fig. _REF_ with original sine-wave signal and normalized autocorrelation functionfor a graphical representation of the result. 
The attenuation of the autocorrelation functionwith increasing lag is caused by the fact that a finite signal is considered. 
A finite signal on the interval _MATH_ can be considered as the multiplication of the infinite signal and a block function with amplitude 1 and with its basis on _MATH_. 
Since a block function has a triangular autocorrelation functionand the superposition principle holds, the amplitude of every autocorrelation functionof a finite sequence will decrease with increasing lag.
The task of the adaptive filter block is to produce an estimate of _MATH_ given _MATH_ and a reference signal. 
Since, there is no scope to provide a separate reference in single channel AEC problem, we intend to utilize some delayed versions of the adaptive filter output as the reference signal. 
The error signal which the adaptive filter tries to minimize can be defined as, _MATHDISP_ where, _MATH_ is an estimate of the echo signal generated by the adaptive filter utilizing its coefficient vector _MATH_ and the echo suppressed input signal _MATH_ and can be expressed as _MATHDISP_.
For simplicity, let us suppose that the fast kink mode in the coronal loop is generated by the interaction of an EIT wave with a loop and the forcing term of the interaction is modelled by a delta-pulse, i.e. the equation describing the dynamics of impulsively generated fast kink mode is given by _MATHDISP_. 
This equation can be solved using standard Laplace transform technique to yield _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the zeroth-order Bessel function and _MATH_ is the Heaviside function. 
The impulsive excitation of waves in a flux tube leads to the formation of a pulse that propagates away with the speed _MATH_, followed by a wake in which the flux tube oscillates with the frequency _MATH_. 
A typical temporal variation of the amplitude of kink waves (keeping the height constant) would show that the amplitude of the mode decreases (even in the absence of dissipation) and an e-fold decay occurs in about 400 seconds .
From the mass dependence of _MATH_ in Fig. _REF_ it is discernible that the plasmino contribution decreases with increasing quark mass. 
This is in accordance with the expectation that for heavy quarks the spectral function reduces to one of free quarks. 
Only small deviations from sum rule (_REF_) are found with a mismatch of less than _MATH_. 
Furthermore we find the minimum of _MATH_ at non-vanishing quark mass whereas the plasmino pole increases monotonically with quark mass. 
The slope of _MATH_ and _MATH_ for fixed _MATH_ is temperature dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. 
Compared to the lattice data in Ref. _CITE_ we find qualitative and quantitative similar results. 
The minima in _MATH_ approximately coincide with the lattice results whereas the slopes in _MATH_ and _MATH_ are slightly different. 
However this may be traced back to different definitions of the bare quark mass.
The HSS algorithm generates _MATH_ sample points in a _MATH_-dimensional hypercube using the following relation _CITE_: _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ represent the first _MATH_ prime numbers. 
For the opted problem, 10 PARSEC parameters (_MATH_ and _MATH_ are fixed due to structural and aerodynamic constraints) together with the _MATH_ serve as the design variables.
In Fig. 8, we present the SCR rigidity spectrum derived by each model at 14:00 UT, when most NMs have already started registering the GLE. 
It is clearly seen that the NMBANGLE PPOLA model has a harder spectrum. 
Between the two, the NMBANGLE PPOLA spectrum, at 14:00 UT, is in better agreement with the spectrum calculated for the same GLE at the same time by Bombardieri et al. (2007), especially in the rigidity range above 2 GV. 
Moreover, the NMBANGLE PPOLA model, in the higher rigidity range (above 2 GV), gives high differential rigidity fluxes, that are in general in good agreement with the fluxes calculated during relative phases of other GLEs. 
For example, the rigidity spectrum (above 2 GV) of the GLE of 29 September 1989, as it is presented in the work of Lovell, Duldig and Humble (1998), is in good agreement with that calculated applying the NMBANGLE PPOLA model. 
In the lower rigidity range, however, the spectrum of Lovell et al., (1998) gives higher differential fluxes, probably due to the more intense GLE registered during that time. 
Summarizing, we can sustain that the NMBANGLE PPOLA model spectrum should be more realistic than that calculated by the NMBANGLE model.
Another example is the evaluation of the effectiveness of social programs _CITE_. 
Evaluating the effectiveness of certain programs using cross-sectional sample typically suffers from the fact that those receiving treatment are different from those without. 
In other words, one does not simultaneously observe what happens to an individual when she receives the treatment or when she does not. 
An individual is observed as either receiving treatment or not receiving treatment. 
Using the difference between the treatment group and control group could suffer from two sources of biases, selection bias due to differences in observable factors between the treatment and control groups and selection bias due to endogeneity of participation in treatment. 
For instance, Northern Territory (NT) in Australia decriminalized possession of small amount of marijuana in 1996. 
Evaluating the effects of decriminalization on marijuana smoking behavior by comparing the differences between NT and other states that were still non-decriminalized could suffer from either or both sorts of bias. 
If panel data over this time period are available, it would allow the possibility of observing the before- and affect-effects on individuals of decriminalization as well as providing the possibility of isolating the effects of treatment from other factors affecting the outcome.
Since BSDEs (_REF_) and (_REF_) are linear, we have explicit formulas for the solutions. 
For _MATH_, we get: _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ defined by _MATHDISP_. 
For _MATH_, we get : _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ defined by _MATHDISP_, where the parameters _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are given by _MATHDISP_. 
The price at time _MATH_ of the European option _MATH_ is equal to _MATH_ if _MATH_ and _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
Once we know the processes _MATH_ and _MATH_, a hedging strategy _MATH_ is given by (_REF_) and (_REF_).
In this section, we present our methodology for parallelizing and optimizing irregular reductions on the explicitly managed memory hierarchy of the Cell processor. 
Our approach uses the inspector-executor paradigm _CITE_ and a region-based computation partitioning which adopts the principles in the data-centric computations _CITE_. 
In order to efficiently orchestrate the data movement among on-chip and off-chip memories, it is advantageous to have a good control over data usages. 
We define a region as a partition of iterations from an irregular reduction loop, in such a way that the iterations, which belong to the same region, access the identical set of the data array blocks. 
As for the example in Code _REF_, each iteration of the loop can be mapped to a point on a two-dimensional space (i.e., a plane) according to the values of p1 and p2. 
We then subdivide the plane into a regular-sized grid, where each grid element is a region, as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
The data used by the iterations of a particular region are bounded to at most two contiguous blocks of the arrays. 
For example, the iterations of region (1, 2) shown in Fig. _REF_ only access the elements of the data arrays (e.g. force and positions) within the second and third blocks of those arrays. 
The details of finding a region space and partitioning iterations are described in Section _REF_ and _REF_.
Before turning to the proof, it is worth me ntioning that the authors in _CITE_ propose a heuristic argument showing _MATH_ for smoothly varying vectors _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ (see Remark _REF_), this heuristic supports the claim of the theorem.
A. Here the analytical techniques break down, because there is no clear relationship between the variation in transmission produced by a new modifier allele and the mean transmission probabilities _REF_ in the population. 
Based on the ubiquity of the reduction result, one can conjecture that a form of reduction result will hold, but its exact form requires analysis that can handle more general forms of variation in transmission.
Let _MATH_ be an arbitrary value. 
Let us consider the following decomposition _MATHDISP_, where the set _MATH_ is defined by _REF_, and _MATH_ and _MATH_ are measurable subsets of _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_. 
Following _CITE_ (see also _CITE_), we have: for any _MATH_ there exists a positive value _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ small enough. 
Since _MATH_ by the initial assumptions, it follows from _REF_-_REF_ that the vector-valued function _MATH_ is Gateaux differentiable. 
Hence, the operator _MATH_ is Gateaux differentiable for any regular point _MATH_ and for any admissible control _MATH_, and its Gateaux derivative takes the form _REF_.
Throughout the sequel, we suppose that (HD), (HBI) and (HC) are satisfied. 
We consider that the price process _MATH_ evolves according to the equation _MATHDISP_. 
All processes _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are assumed to be _MATH_-predictable. 
We introduce the following assumptions on the coefficients appearing in the dynamic of _MATH_: 
The processes _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are uniformly bounded: there exists a constant _MATH_ s.t. _MATHDISP_.
Consider the following discrete-time impulsive system with time-varying delays _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the state, _MATH_ is the control input, _MATH_ is the value of _MATH_ at _MATH_ before the impulse and _MATH_ is the value of _MATH_ at _MATH_ after impulse. 
_MATH_ is the time delay. 
_MATH_ is the impulsive gain matrix when system (_REF_) switches from _MATH_th subsystem to _MATH_th subsystem. 
_MATH_ is the impulsive controller. 
The switching rule _MATH_ takes values from a finite set _MATH_.
Classical and quantum theory is not locally causal in the sense of Bell. 
Indeed Bell himself noticed that ordinary quantum mechanics, even the relativistic quantum field theory, is not local causal in the sense of his local causality condition. 
He consider the following example. 
Suppose we have a radioactive nucleus which can emit a single _MATH_-particle, surrounded at a considerable distance by _MATH_-particle counters. 
So long as it is not specified that some other counter registers, there is a chance for a particular counter that it registers. 
But if it is specified that some other counter does register, even in a region of space-time outside the relevant backward light cone, the chance that the given counter registers is zero. 
We simply do not have the above local causality condition.
The assumption that the level curves have zero Lebesgue measure is a technical one and perhaps it is not necessary. 
We need it here to get condition (A) in Theorem _REF_. 
On the other hand, in most practical cases this assumption is fulfilled.
In this section, we prove Theorem _REF_ (f) and Corollary _REF_. 
We start by introducing some notation. 
If _MATH_ is a nonnegative real random variable, defined on some probability space _MATH_, and _MATH_, then we define the size-biased law _MATH_ associated with _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ is a _MATH_-valued random variable, defined on some probability space _MATH_, such that _MATH_, then we define a probability law _MATH_ on the product space _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_. 
We call _MATH_ the Campbell law associated with _MATH_. 
It is not hard to see that the projection of _MATH_ onto _MATH_ is the size-biased law _MATH_. 
Moreover, if we let _MATH_ denote the projection from _MATH_ to _MATH_ and we use the symbol _MATH_ to denote (also) the random variable on _MATH_ defined by _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_, i.e., conditional on _MATH_, the site _MATH_ is chosen with equal probabilities from all sites in _MATH_. 
We may view _MATH_ as a "typical" element of _MATH_. 
Campbell laws are closely related to the more widely known Palm laws; both play an important role in the theory of branching processes (see, e.g., _CITE_).
An annulus with center _MATH_, inner radius _MATH_ and outer radius _MATH_ is the set of points _MATH_ whose distance to the center satisfies _MATH_. 
The boundary of an annulus consists of two _MATH_-spheres and we call the smaller one the inner sphere and the larger one the outer sphere. 
We say that an annulus _MATH_ is tangent to _MATH_ at _MATH_ if one of the two spheres bounding _MATH_ is tangent to _MATH_ at _MATH_ (see Fig. _REF_, or Fig. _REF_ for a more intricate example). 
Point _MATH_ is called a tangency point of _MATH_. 
An annulus is hollow if its inner sphere bounds a _MATH_-ball whose interior does not intersect _MATH_; notice that _MATH_ might intersect the annulus itself. 
The width of an annulus is the difference between the outer and inner radii _MATH_. 
We define the penetration of an annulus to be the maximum radius of the intersection of the annulus with a flat, such that the open ball bounded by the inner sphere remains empty; see Fig. _REF_. 
Specifically, the penetration is _MATH_. 
We are mostly concerned with annuli of penetration _MATH_; such an annulus has width _MATH_.
Therefore _MATH_ cannot be applied directly in this way, but realizing that _MATH_ is a byte-oriented operation, it is clear that the equality holds if one restricts comparison to every bit position except the first and last bit of every byte. 
This is easy to realize if one considers the origin and destination byte of the six middlemost bits as _MATH_ is applied. 
One single bit shift does not affect the destination byte of these bits. 
Furthermore, a peripheral bit that is shifted out of its byte position is mapped to another peripheral bit position. 
We therefore have _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes equality with respect to the six middlemost bits of each byte. 
The same arguments apply to _MATH_, so we define _MATHDISP_ to obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Loosely put, we can essentially bypass the effects of the _MATH_ and _MATH_ operations by ignoring the peripheral bits of each byte.
Now observe that _MATHDISP_. 
Taking things together proves that _MATHDISP_ is negligible as desired. 
We note that it is easy to see that _REF_ does not strongly obfuscate _MATH_(in the sense of _REF_). 
Moreover, with a little tweak we can also show that _REF_ does not imply the predicate-based _REF_ (even when not taking auxiliary information into consideration). 
Given a one-way permutation _MATH_ define the related permutation _MATH_ by _MATH_ (where _MATH_ a bit). 
Then _MATH_ is one-way iff _MATH_ is, yet the point function obfuscation using _MATH_ clearly leaks the first bit of its input (hence a predicate).
The proportion of accepted values (i.e. the number of times we keep _MATH_) is an acceptance rate (AR), useful in assessing coverage and convergence to the target distribution _MATH_. 
The proposal distribution can be tuned during the burn-in period to satisfy _MATH_, as discussed in Gelman, Roberts and Gilks (1996).
The preceding considerations preclude computing the vacuum polarization in static coordinates, but they in no way prevent us from working out what fields would be perceived by an observer, on the conformal coordinate manifold, who moves in such a way as to remain static with respect to a point source at the origin. 
This amounts to merely transforming results from conformal coordinates into static coordinates. 
If the source is at the static coordinate origin then an observer at fixed _MATH_ would appear, in conformal coordinates, to be moving towards the origin with precisely the velocity needed to counteract the expansion of spacetime and maintain a constant physical distance from the source. 
Such an observer will experience effects associated with boosting the conformal field strength, and other effects associated with shrinking the conformal coordinate separation to zero. 
By substituting (_REF_-_REF_) in (_REF_) we see that the coordinate transformation is, _MATHDISP_. 
The various components of the Jacobian are, _MATHDISP_. 
We denote the static coordinate field strengths with a tilde, _MATHDISP_. 
The factors of _MATH_ seem to drive _MATH_ to zero but one has to keep in mind that a factor of _MATH_ grows at fixed _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Note also that the scale factor is, _MATHDISP_.
As we think of applications to large mass-action models in computational chemistry and biology, attention will be in the following on the particular case when the dependence of the vector field _MATH_ in _REF_ on the parameter vector _MATH_ is affine, i.e., for every _MATH_ and every _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Here, we assume that each _MATH_ is continuous with respect to _MATH_ and satisfies certain Lipschitz conditions with respect to _MATH_ uniform in _MATH_. 
For the non-parametric problem _MATHDISP_, it is classical that the right-hand-side _MATH_ being locally Lipschitz continuous, i.e., for every _MATH_ there is a neighborhood _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ for some constants _MATH_, implies existence and uniqueness of local solutions of _REF_, i.e., existence of unique solutions on some maximally extended subinterval _MATH_. 
This result is classical in the scalar case _MATH_, and it extends immediately to the general state space _MATH_ considered here, see e.g. _CITE_. 
In the parametric case the naive way would be to assume this condition to hold pointwise, i.e., for every fixed _MATH_ the local Lipschitz condition _REF_ holds for _MATH_. 
This assumption then yields local existence of the parametric solution, but unfortunately the existence-interval _MATH_ might depend on the parameter, i.e., in this argument _MATH_ cannot be chosen independent of _MATH_.
The fact that microwave and hard X-ray emissions show the similar profile during the solar flare suggests that both are generated by a common population of energetic electrons. 
According to the standard model, when these electrons propagate along the lines of magnetic field toward the photosphere, they interact with the surrounding atmosphere and emit hard X-ray bremsstrahlung and gyrosynchrotron microwave radiation as they lose energy via Coulomb collisions in the lower atmosphere (e.g. Dennis and Schwartz, 1989). 
A number of pieces of observational evidence have been found to support that microwave and hard X-ray emissions are produced by nonthermal electrons at the lower solar atmosphere layer during flare eruption (e.g. Takakura and Kai, 1966; Kiplinger et al., 1983; Nakajima et al., 1983; Gary, 1985; Schmahl, Kundu, and Dennis, 1985; Aschwanden, Benz, and Kane, 1990; Aschwanden, 1998; Bastian, Benz, and Gary, 1998; Asai et al., 2001). 
A general way to derive the physical information of these nonthermal electrons is to study the spectral behaviours of microwave or hard X-ray emission. 
Because the spectral index can provide the most direct avenue for determining the distribution of nonthermal electrons and the energy they contain.
Another paradigmatic example of the occurrence of substructural kinetic energy appears in the direct models of elastic structures. 
In one-dimensional schemes of beams the macroscopic kinetic energy (the one generated by _MATH_) is associated with the centre of mass of each section while substructural kinetic energy (or, which is the same, the related co-energy) describes rotational kinetics of cross-sections (see e.g. [SMK]).
The main objective of this chapter is to present the actual development and experimental validation of SOSM controllers, previously reviewed and analysed in this book. 
As anticipated, the controllers were designed and implemented in the real FC based generation workbench introduced and modelled in Chapter 5. 
Three control set-ups based on Super Twisting, Twisting and Sub-Optimal algorithms were developed. 
As detailed in Chapter 4, power conversion optimization of the laboratory PEM fuel cell system is seek via oxygen stoichiometry regulation. 
In the implementation, the effect of practical problems such as saturation and possible wind-up have been also taken into account and counteracted.
Since an analytical solution to the model fitting problem is often intractable, the practical approach to such problems is to give a numerical simulation of a solution. 
Several methods exist for this, see _CITE_. 
The trade-off with all these methods is that typically they offer an estimate of a local optimum, with no guarantee of it being a global optimum.
The most probable distribution method is a way of deriving a probability distribution by maximizing the multiplicity of the outcomes under the presence of some constraint on the system. 
Such a methodology corresponds to finding the distribution associated to the minimum available quantity of information regarding the system or, alternatively, the maximum uncertainty about its actual state _CITE_.
Recall that the dynamics inside the vortex-bubble are illustrated in Figure _MATH_ of _CITE_ (the bubble itself is shown in the forth frame of our Figure _REF_). 
Then the dynamics inside the bubble consist largely of rotational/toroidal dynamics about the _MATH_-line. 
When _MATH_ is not too large, this has the effect of forcing the one-dimensional manifolds through the hole of the torus. 
This forces the close pass between _MATH_ and the fixed point _MATH_.
No Recombination with the Modifier Locus. 
The analysis here follows Karlin's _CITE_ application of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational characterization of the spectral radius (_CITE_, _CITE_), which requires that _MATH_ be symmetrizable - i.e. of the form _MATH_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are positive diagonal matrices, and _MATH_ is a real symmetric matrix.
Let _MATH_ and _MATH_ be the standard Jacobi polynomial of degree _MATH_. 
We have that _MATHDISP_. 
Besides, _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_, then we define the weighted space _MATH_ as usual, equipped with the following inner product and norm, _MATHDISP_. 
The set of Jacobi polynomials forms a complete _MATH_-orthogonal system, and _MATHDISP_.
Nunez-Queija _CITE_ considers an _MATH_ type with processor sharing service discipline. 
The server is subject to breakdown. 
The breakdown occurs according to a Poisson process and the duration of the breakdown have a general distribution. 
Using branching process approach the author establishes a decomposition result for the sojourn time in which the components are independent of each other. 
In steady state it is shown that the expected sojourn time is not proportional to the service requirement.
Our concept is based on using six spherical, gold coated mirrors in a circular configuration. 
The geometry of the cell is shown in Fig. _REF_. 
The six spherical mirrors, each 8mm high and about 48mm wide rectangular slice of a sphere, having 50mm radius of curvature, form a nearly continuous ring with approximately 100mm inner diameter. 
A 12.6mm space between two of the mirrors is reserved for coupling optics. 
In this design, the laser beam bounces back and forth between the mirrors and stepwise advances along the circumference of the cell until it reaches again the coupling lens. 
Consequently, the maximum number of passes is determined by the beam size and separation of the adjacent reflections. 
To minimize interference fringes, neighboring reflection spots must not overlap and mirror edges must be avoided.
On the other hand the permutation symmetry of multi-electron wavefunctions is restricted by the Pauli principle. 
The total wavefunction should be antisymmetric with respect to exchange of any pair of electrons. 
Hence, in the symmetric group _MATH_, or, for an n-electron system, the symmetric group, _MATH_, the total wavefunction should change sign under odd permutations, i.e. under permutations that consist of an odd number of transpositions of two elements, and should remain invariant under even permutations. 
Until now we have limited ourselves to the spatial part of the wavefunction. 
So far, only the antisymmetrized part obeys the Pauli principle. 
However, the principle places a requirement only on the total wavefunction. 
This also involves a spin part, which should be multiplied by the orbital part. 
Anticipating the results of Chapter 7, we here provide the spin functions for a two-electron system. 
Spin functions are characterized by a spin quantum number, _MATH_, and a component, _MATH_, in the range _MATH_. 
The total number of components, hence the dimension of the spin-space for a given _MATH_, is equal to _MATH_. 
This number is called the spin multiplicity. 
For a two-electron system, _MATH_ can be 0 or 1; hence, there is one singlet state, and there are three components belonging to a triplet state. 
In a _MATH_ notation they are given by: _MATHDISP_ 
These functions also exhibit permutation symmetry: the triplet functions are symmetric under exchange of the two particles, while the singlet function is antisymmetric under such an exchange. 
The total wavefunction can thus always be put in line with the Pauli principle by combining the coupled orbital states with spin states of opposite permutation symmetry. 
Altogether we can thus construct four states: _MATH_. 
This set of four states, totalling 24 wavefunctions, forms a manifold, representing all the coupled states resulting from the _MATH_ configuration. 
The dimension of the manifold is equal to the product of the six possible _MATH_ substates (including spin), and the four possible _MATH_ substates. 
In this case, where the coupling involves electrons belonging to different shells, the Pauli principle does not restrict the total dimension of the manifold, since all combinations remain possible. 
All states can be written as linear combinations of Slater determinants. 
As an example, for the _MATH_ state, one writes: _MATHDISP_
In this chapter, as well as in Chapters _REF_ and _REF_, we shall use the symbols introduced in Subsection _REF_ and the following notation.
According to the processing given in Equations _REF_, _REF_, _REF_, the minimal T-invariants of the example net in Figure _REF_ lead to the following feasible invariants: _MATHDISP_. 
Because of their combinatorial generation, the number of feasible T-invariants may increase exponentially (since a non-feasible one generates a new one with each invariant providing a token at the critical place). 
One possibility to avoid redundant information within the set of feasible T-invariants is the formulation of biologically motivated restrictions. 
For example in a PN which models the iron homeostasis process _CITE_ it makes sense to delete feasible invariants containing more than one (of four possible) ways of iron uptake.
We note that these arguments can easily be extended to the case of nearly-congruent cylinders, that is, when the radii of the cylinders are different, but vary between some constant _MATH_ and 1. 
In this case, a cell _MATH_ that contains both narrow and wide cylinders implies that the smallest radius _MATH_ of a cylinder that meets _MATH_ satisfies _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the width of _MATH_. 
That is, a narrow cylinder cannot be "too narrow" in this case. 
Following the notation of Section _REF_, we elaborate Lemma _REF_ by refining the decomposition of the slab _MATH_, and adding at least _MATH_ planes parallel to _MATH_, thereby obtaining subslabs _MATH_ of smaller width. 
The analysis then proceeds verbatim as in the original problem.
The common Nash equilibriums in _MATH_ have tolerance _MATH_ over _MATH_. 
We conclude that the algorithm does not provide better solutions (with 2-memory) than the 1-memory sub-Nash solutions.
We specialize _MATHDISP_. 
Realizing the teleportation in this case means that Alice has to perform measurements _MATH_ in the whole space _MATH_ and also Bob (concerning _MATH_).
Weak magnetic fields, which cause the Zeeman splitting of the magnetic sublevels on the order of _MATH_, can be measured on a background of a larger, stable and known magnetic field, but not separately, because in this case there are no limitations due to the difficulty in registration of the coherent dark resonance with the frequency comparable with its own spectral width or even smaller. 
With this measurement technique, the absolute resolving power for the magnetic field measurements will be the same as for the larger field.
The final step before combining the _MATH_-type and _MATH_-type currents is to put them in a common form by isolating distinct logarithms and making judicious use of the identities, _MATHDISP_. 
The results are, _MATHDISP_. 
Adding expressions (_REF_) and (_REF_) gives a current density which is much simpler than either of them separately, _MATHDISP_. 
Finally, it is useful to introduce the symbol _MATH_ for _MATH_ times the part of (_REF_) within the curly brackets, _MATHDISP_.
The genome is structured in two parts: a group of loci experiencing natural selection, and, external to the group, a neutral locus that modifies their genetic transmission probabilities. 
The model assumes an infinite population, random mating, non-overlapping generations, frequency-independent viability selection, sex symmetry, and no sex-linkage. 
Although selection acts on diploid genotypes, the haplotype frequencies become dynamically sufficient state variables under random mating. 
Haplotypes have two indices: one for the haplotype of the loci under selection (_MATH_), and one for the allele at the modifier locus (_MATH_). 
The modifier allele is assumed to be transmitted without alteration and in Mendelian proportions (no mutation nor segregation distortion), so that the only force acting upon it is from associations it forms with the loci under selection.
We present simulations with _MATH_ (simulation 1 or S1) and _MATH_ (S2), in order to demonstrate the effects on type III bursts of the coronal background electrons and ions with kappa distributions. 
Both _MATH_ indices fall within the range inferred by _CITE_. 
The two simulations are compared with the third simulation (S3), where the background plasma is the corresponding Maxwellian; i.e., the same _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_ but _MATH_ in Equation (_REF_). 
For S1-S3 all the other simulation parameters discussed below are the same.
The meteorological data used in this section has been recollected during one year by a meteorological station located at the Almeria, Spain, _MATH_ _MATH_. 
For this database, solar irradiance samples are acquired every minute. 
As commented above, the KFDF technique requires a theoretical model to obtain data for fusion purposes. 
In this case, the model for direct irradiance explained in Sect. _REF_ has been used _CITE_.
The jump of the reconstructed point-values in _REF_ is given by _MATHDISP_.
For any _MATH_, the process _MATHDISP_, is an _MATH_-supermartingale. 
Furthermore, the optimal strategy _MATH_ is characterized by the martingale property, i.e., _MATH_ is an _MATH_-martingale.
Hence condition (3') does not hold. 
The vector field associated with this potential is given by _MATHDISP_. 
We consider the evolution of the path according to Eq. (_REF_). 
In particular, we consider the evolution of the point of the path lying on the negative _MATH_-semiaxis. 
It is easy to see that _MATH_ on the negative _MATH_-semiaxis. 
Hence the point _MATH_ of the initial path will stay on the negative _MATH_-semiaxis. 
Therefore, its time evolution is given by _MATHDISP_. 
Then _MATHDISP_. 
Eq. (_REF_) shows that if _MATH_ then _MATH_. 
The limit set of the path consists of the saddles at _MATH_ and _MATH_, the minima at _MATH_ and _MATH_, and four trajectories emanating from the saddles, two of which go to the minima, and the other two - to infinity. 
Geometrically, the limit set consists of two half-lines (Fig. _REF_). 
The path converges to every point of its limit set which is 1D, however, the limit set is not connected and not of finite length.
In this section, we present examples illuminating the impact of a critical point of Morse index 2 on the limit set of a path. 
First, we show how a path, initially not passing through the stable manifold of a saddle of Morse index _MATH_ can end up passing through such a saddle. 
Second, we demonstrate that a Morse index _MATH_ critical point might make the limit set very sensitive to the initial path even if the limit set is a curve. 
Finally, we give an example of a path whose limit set contains a 2D surface while the initial path neither passes through a Morse index two saddle nor intersects its stable manifold.
Suppose that customers arrive to a service center (call center, web server, etc.) with two stations in accordance with independent Poisson processes. 
Service times at either station follow the same general distribution, are independent of each other and are independent of the arrival process. 
The system is charged station dependent holding costs at each station per customer per unit time. 
At any point in time, a decision-maker may decide to move, at a cost, some number of jobs in one queue to the other. 
The goals of this paper are twofold. 
First, we are interested in providing insights into this decision-making scenario. 
We do so, in the important case that the service time distribution is highly variable or simply has a heavy tail. 
Second, we propose that the savvy use of Markov decision processes can lead to easily implementable heuristics when features of the service time distribution can be captured by introducing multiple customer classes. 
To this end, we consider a two-station proxy for the original system, where the service times are assumed to be exponential, but of one of two classes with different rates. 
We prove structural results for this proxy and show that these results lead to heuristics that perform well.
The results from the discrete-time attrition hazard model are reported in Table _REF_. 
We also estimated separate logit models for each year in order to see whether the covariate effects differ from year to year. 
The estimates from the separate logit models are not shown but they are discussed in the following text when relevant.
The contribution of the viscoplastic deformation is considered next. 
A classical expression is used to describe the viscoplastic flow evolution, given by _MATH_, which assumes that the viscoplastic deformation accumulates in the direction of the deviatoric stress _MATH_, and its magnitude is determined by the rate of the viscoplastic multiplier _MATH_: _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ the flow direction, defined in terms of the deviatoric part of the Kirchhoff stress tensor as: _MATHDISP_. 
Note, that the relations _REF_ and _REF_ ensure the fulfillment of the inequality _REF_. 
The definition of the plastic flow given by Eq. _REF_ is completed by postulating a zero viscoplastic spin _CITE_: _MATHDISP_. 
Next, _MATH_ is defined by a Zener-Hollomon type decomposition _CITE_: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is an Arrhenius type thermal function and _MATH_ is the Zener parameter, which is a temperature normalized measure of _MATH_; _MATH_ is the drag strength, accounting for the isotropic hardening. 
Viscoplastic deformation will take place provided that: _MATHDISP_. where _MATH_ is the yield stress, here assumed to depend on the temperature only, since hardening is accounted for in _REF_.
As a useful default hyperprior, which is commonly-used in the literature, one can let _MATH_. 
This allows uncertainty in _MATH_, while favoring a sparse specification that tends to allocate individuals to few latent classes relative to the sample size. 
In particular, the rate of introduction of new classes under the Dirichlet process is proportional to _MATH_. 
In our experience, the data are typically quite informative about _MATH_, with the posterior centered away from _MATH_ if the data are consistent with a different value. 
It is clear from (_REF_) that the latent classes having the highest weights, _MATH_, will be occupied quickly as subjects are added, but that there will be infinitely-many classes having extremely small probabilities. 
This allows for very rare traits (e.g., corresponding to a rare health condition or psychological disorder) that may be quite unlikely to be observed in a moderate sized sample, but may be occasionally present in large samples.
BMP (BitMaP) Introduced in 1990 by Microsoft for Windows 3.0, not patented, the BMP format gained soon wide acceptance by graphic programs. 
It allows depths of 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32 bits/pixel. 
Although provided for the cases of 16 and 256 colors, compression is usually not exploited due to the inefficiency of the RLE (lossless) algorithm. 
Thus, the most used (uncompressed) version has a representation on disk similar to its RAM counterpart. 
Even if this improves read and write speed, because the processor is not in charge of thoroughly processing the data contained in the file, the drawback is that the space needed to represent an image is quite large, which prevents the use of this format on the Web. 
Another shortcoming is the fact that, in version 3 (the most commonly used), differently from versions 4 and 5, the alpha channel is not provided and personalized color spaces cannot be defined. 
The latest version allows to exploit a color profile taken from an external file, and to embed JPEG and PNG images (to be introduced later in this section).
In contrast to above results favoring the rigid rotation of active longitudes, _CITE_ report two persistent active longitudes _MATH_ apart, their migration relative to Carrington frame being defined by the differential rotation and the mean latitude of sunspot formation.
The Interval Model is a model of diffusion in a bounded domain in which the number of substrate molecules is fixed. 
We consider diffusion in the interval _MATH_. 
Use of the simple diffusion equation implicitly assumes that the underlying particle trajectories are non-interacting in the interior of the interval. 
However, there is a single-occupancy binding site at _MATH_. 
The Spherical Model is a model of diffusion in an unbounded domain that contains a very large number of substrate molecules. 
The system is assumed to be spherically symmetrical and considers spatial variation as a function of the radial variable _MATH_. 
Particle trajectories in the domain _MATH_ are assumed to be non-interacting, but there is a single-occupancy binding site at _MATH_. 
When the diffusion equation is written in terms of _MATH_, a Smoluchowski equation is obtained which includes a geometrical drift term. 
These models are examples of exclusion processes _CITE_.
In contrast to first-order equation (_REF_), equation (_REF_) includes the singular term _MATH_ produced by the power series expansion of the perturbation in equation (_REF_). 
If the perturbation is smooth then _MATH_ and such a singular term disappear _CITE_. 
Nevertheless, it is shown below that the second-order approximation remains valid even in the discontinuous case, when _MATH_.
Suppose that _MATH_ is SS. 
Then there exists the maximal solution _MATH_ of (_REF_). 
Suppose, in addition, that _MATH_ is SD. 
Then _MATH_ is the mean square stabilizing solution and the unique positive semi-definite solution to (_REF_). 
Moreover, for arbitrary terminal condition _MATH_, we have for the unique solution _MATH_, _MATH_, to (_REF_), that _MATH_ as _MATH_.The existence of the maximal solution follows from Theorem _REF_ in the Appendix _REF_, Section _REF_. 
That this solution is mean square stabilizing and the unique positive semi-definite solution to (_REF_) follows from Corollary _REF_ in the Appendix _REF_, Section _REF_. 
Finally the convergence of _MATH_ as _MATH_ follows from Corollary _REF_ in the Appendix _REF_, Section _REF_.
The integrals of the second form (_REF_) _MATH_ and _MATH_ contain an extra factor _MATH_- in the denominator as compared to _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
On the formal level this leads to a divergency of these two integrals at the point _MATH_. 
However in the sum _MATH_ this divergence cancels. 
Indeed using our approximate expressions for _MATH_ and _MATH_ valid in the region (_REF_) we find _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Obviously the integrand is not singular at _MATH_.
We start by describing the Yang et al. (2007) CDP prior. 
In particular, if _MATH_, with _MATH_, we say that _MATH_ corresponds to a CDP(_MATH_) prior if _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ correspond to the unconstrained mean and covariance under a DP(_MATH_) prior, _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_, for _MATH_.
We can further generalize the above teleportation schemes, namely, replacing the projectors _MATH_ by projectors _MATH_ defined as follows. _MATHDISP_ 
In order to make this definition precise we assume, in addition to (_REF_), that is holds: _MATHDISP_. 
Together with (_REF_) that implies _MATHDISP_. 
Formally we have the same relation between _MATH_ and _MATH_ like the relation between _MATH_ and _MATH_ (c.f. Remark ). 
Further for each pair _MATH_ we define channels on normal states on _MATH_ such as _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_.
Notice first that _MATH_ is always positive. 
Indeed, it is always non-negative since one of the branches of the trisector of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ is defined for all _MATH_ in _MATH_ (since each branch is monotonic in _MATH_ and one of them has only one asymptote, by Lemma _REF_). 
It thus follows from the fact that the trisector has no real singular point (Theorem _REF_) that _MATH_ is always positive. 
Notice also that, for any _MATH_ in _MATH_, _MATH_ has two distinct real roots by Proposition _REF_.
The following result gives the OSNR model for a point-to-point WDM link developed based on (_REF_), (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
An earlier similar simple model can be found in _CITE_.
Under prior _MATH_, the conditional posterior is _MATH_ _MATHDISP_.
Based on market share statistics from Asset-Backed Alert, Moody's was involved in approximately 55% of MBS transactions from 2000 to 2003, and during that time has rated around 63% of the issued volume (see Table _REF_). 
The MBS category as per Asset-Backed Alert's classification corresponds largely to the respective category in Moody's transaction classification logic. 
Consequently, the number of transactions reported for Moody's in Asset-Backed Alert's statistic broadly matches those in Moody's own database. 
HEL as per Moody's classification logic are included in Asset-Backed Alert's statistic for ABS. 
In this category Moody's market shares tend to be significantly higher (88% of transactions and 95% of the issued volume). 
It can therefore be assumed that the transactions in Moody's database correspond to broadly 70% of all transactions of the respective market data.
Now we are going to demonstrate that one can also calculate our integrals in the standard manner, factorizing them into two independent ones over _MATH_. 
Take integral _MATH_. 
As mentioned one cannot neglect _MATH_ in the first denominator and _MATH_- in the second without losing convergence. 
To preserve it we consider the sum of integrals (_REF_) and (_REF_) _MATHDISP_. 
Here _MATH_. 
One observes that convergence in _MATH_- is improved. 
In order to do this with respect to _MATH_ we first pass to integration over _MATH_ with _MATH_ and then rename _MATH_ to obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Taking half the sum of (_REF_) and (_REF_) we finally find _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_. 
Now both factors have enough convergence to put _MATH_ in the first one and _MATH_- in the second. 
The integrals factorizes in two. _MATHDISP_- where _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_- Obviously the result (_REF_) is identical to the the sum of (_REF_) and (_REF_) calculated previously by a different method.
We now have as nodal coordinates of the non-linear two-node superelement two sets of Cartesian coordinates, _MATH_ and _MATH_, describing the nodal positions in the inertial coordinate system and two sets of Euler parameters, _MATH_ and _MATH_, representing the orientation of the triads _MATH_ and _MATH_ at nodes _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The vector _MATH_ of nodal coordinates can then be written as _MATHDISP_. 
Note that the parameterization of rotations is redundant due to the constraint _MATH_, imposed on the Euler parameters of Eq. (_REF_). 
This results in a total of twelve independent nodal coordinates.
In the papers that begin with _CITE_, however, Ehrenpreis fixes his attention on the way in which these results are far reaching generalizations of well known function theory theorems. 
For example, if _MATH_, _MATH_, and if _MATH_, with _MATH_ being now the Laplacian, then one can consider a very special differential relation, say _MATHDISP_, and then any general theorem will end up being a generalization of what is known as the reflection theorem, namely the theorem that states that harmonic functions in the half space _MATH_, which satisfy _MATH_, can be extended to harmonic functions on all of _MATH_.
SEMs provide a broad framework for modeling of multivariate data having mixed categorical and continuous measurement scales. 
For subject _MATH_ (_MATH_), the observed data consist of _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a _MATH_ vector of outcome measurements and _MATH_ is a _MATH_ vector of predictor measurements. 
Following common practice, we assume that _MATH_, for _MATH_, and _MATH_, for _MATH_, where _MATH_ is linked to an underlying continuous variable _MATH_ through a link function _MATH_ having parameters _MATH_, and _MATH_ is linked to an underlying continuous variable _MATH_ through a link function _MATH_ having parameters _MATH_. 
Typically, for continuous measurements, identity links will be used, so that _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
In contrast, for categorical measurements, threshold links will be used mapping from _MATH_ to _MATH_, with _MATH_ the number of categories.
other higher order errors (such as triangular coma due to the M1 support): Interferometric measurements have shown that they have only minor contributions to the overall wavefront error, furthermore, there is no degree of freedom for correction anyway. 
Higher order modes need not to be sensed.
This chapter proposes AETOS, the Adaptive Epidemic Tree overlay Service. 
AETOS is an agent-based system that builds and maintains application-independent tree overlays, on demand. 
To this purpose three local agents are defined to (i) abstract application requirements to self-organisation requirements, (ii) self-organise nodes in various optimised tree topologies based on these requirements and (iii) control the bootstrapping and termination of self-organisation. 
Experiments show that a high level of connectivity can be acquired, and that cost-effectiveness of self-organisation is highly correlated to the available local knowledge, the tree topology, and the network size.
In Fig. _REF_ (m) to (r) we assume that the statistics of the out-of-plane orientation _MATH_ are identical to the in-plane orientation of the flame sheet. 
The pdf shown in Fig. _REF_ (m) is calculated from the angle (_MATH_) between _MATH_ and the normal of the mean-progress-variable in the laser-sheet plane. 
If we assume that such a pdf mimics the distribution for _MATH_ the pdfs for (o) to (r) are obtained. 
Although there is clearly some bias towards high velocities, there is still remarkable similarity between the pdfs of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
This assumption of isotropy may not be unreasonable and has been discussed before e.g in _CITE_, where similar widths for the angular distribution were found.
This method can produce a good approximation of _MATH_ assuming that a tight bound of smallest eigenvalue _MATH_ and the largest eigenvalue _MATH_ can be found. 
As mentioned in _CITE_, the upper bound must be larger than _MATH_ but it should not be too large as this would otherwise result in slower convergence. 
The simplest technique is to use Gershgorin circle theorem but bounds obtained in this way are usually big overestimates of _MATH_. 
An much better estimation can be obtained inexpensively by using a small number of steps of the Lanczos method _CITE_. 
A safeguard term is added to "quasi"-guarantee that the upper bound is larger than _MATH_. 
It equals the absolute value of the last element of the normalized eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the tridiagonal matrix. 
This safeguard is not theoretical but is observed to be generally effective _CITE_. 
The computations in preconditioning operation consists of the SpMV and level-1 BLAS vector operations, both of which can be performed efficiently on GPUs. 
Typically a small number of steps of Lanczos iterations are enough to provide a good estimate of extreme eigenvalues. 
The Lanczos algorithm can be accelerated by GPUs as well, since the computations it required are also SpMVs and level-1 BLAS vector computations.
We consider the same two networks as in the computational experiments given in Marin (2007), so-called _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively (_MATH_ was also previously considered in Laporte et al. (2007)). 
For the sake of completeness, we reproduce the underlying graphs and data for these networks.
From equations Eq. _MATH_ we readily deduce the following non trivial algebra _MATHDISP_ where the terms _MATH_ are the definitions of Berry curvatures. 
Of course these non trivial commutation relations also give new contributions to the equations of motion and thus lead to new phenomena _CITE_ _CITE__CITE_. 
The commutation relations are valid to any order in _MATH_, but in practice we can compute them as well as the energy _MATH_ in a series expansion in _MATH_. 
Relations Eqs. _MATH_ will be helpful when writing the explicit expression of _MATH_ in a series expansion in _MATH_ in the following section.
This paper is arranged as follows. 
In the second section some introductory concepts such as RL techniques and model-free ANC systems are reviewed. 
A basic ANC method for periodic disturbances based on Q-learning technique are introduced in the second section and advantages and disadvantages are followed. 
Some modifications are suggested in Section 4 to solve the encountered problems. 
Simulation results are presented in the 5th section and finally the methods and results are summarized in Section 6.
It might be natural to expect that a weakening of the assumptions on the domain in embedding theorems of Sobolev type can be compensated by supplementary assumptions on the boundary behavior of the function. 
The question of the influence of such assumptions on Sobolev-type inequalities is considered in Section _REF_. 
Let the space _MATH_ be the completion of _MATH_ equipped with the norm _MATH_.
Given a Boolean expression _MATH_, we can find a vertex set that has a spanning tree of a stabbing number _MATH_, if and only if _MATH_ is satisfiable. 
Consider the vertex set as given in Figure _REF_ with _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ has a satisfying truth assignment, we first connect the vertex on the left side of the drawing into one long path. 
This path contains all horizontal and vertical barrier gadgets as shown in Figure _REF_. 
We connect the variable and literal gadgets according to their values in _MATH_. 
In each true- and false-column, there is a vertex lower than all horizontal barriers, and to the right of all literals in that column. 
We connect this vertex to the right lowest vertex of the lowest literal in the same column. 
Because each clause has at least one true literal, the horizontal stabbing number of a stabber through a clause is at most _MATH_, because the horizontal barrier on the left contributes _MATH_, the variable(s) set to true and the _MATH_ variables that do not appear in the clause contribute two each, and the variable(s) set to false contribute three each, which is at most _MATH_. 
A horizontal stabber through the horizontal barrier in the _MATH_-th variable gadget stabs _MATH_ edges in the barrier, one more edge to the left of the barrier, four edges of the variable to the right of the gadget and two more for each of the _MATH_ variables to its right, for a total of _MATH_. 
A vertical stabber through literals stabs at most _MATH_ edges in the vertical barriers, plus two more, either one from a false literal and one in the variable gadget, or two edges in the true literals. 
So we have a spanning tree of stabbing number _MATH_.
(iii). Under condition _REF_, we already know _MATH_, see Theorem _REF_. 
Repeatedly differentiating the problem _REF_ with respect to _MATH_ as well as applying the composition property of analytic maps then yields _MATH_ for _MATH_ and hence also _MATH_, _MATH_. 
We only note that for an analytic map _MATH_ (the space _MATH_ being the Banach space of all bounded linear operators from the complex Banach space _MATH_ into another complex Banach space _MATH_) the map _MATH_, _MATH_, is again analytic for every _MATH_.
For the _MATH_ family, the explicit form of the superpotentials for _MATH_, are given by _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
Moreover scaling artifacts are expected to be negligible also based on the large plaquette values near _MATH_, see Table _REF_. 
Hence the configurations are smooth, which corresponds to a fine lattice.
In order to determine the depth profiles of the anomalous thermal structure of the active regions, we invert the differences between their frequencies and those of the comparison quiet regions in common mode sets for the variations in sound speed (_MATH_) and of the adiabatic index (_MATH_). 
Our inversions make use of both the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and the Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) techniques ( cf. Antia and Basu 2007).
Given the weighted Kendall's _MATH_ as the true loss for ranking, the existence and uniqueness of the optimal ranking is discussed in _CITE_. 
The sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal ranking are called separability on pairs and transitivity over pairs. 
An intuitive explanation of the separability on pairs is that for any document pair all the optimal rankers obtained in learning can separate (rank) the two documents with exactly the same order. 
And the transitivity over pairs guarantees that if for any _MATH_, if _MATH_ and _MATH_ are separable with the same order, then _MATH_ is also separable with that order.
Note that TILT is mainly effective for rectifying a single character, while our detected text regions usually consists of multiple characters, which can be a short phrase on a street sign or an entry on a restaurant menu. 
Although the images of individual characters may be low-rank, the image of multiple characters may no longer be low-rank anymore w.r.t. its minimal dimension. 
So the original TILT model (_REF_) would not work on an image of multiple characters as robustly as on an individual character. 
To remedy this issue, one could divide the region into multiple smaller ones and measure the overall regularity as the sum of all: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ stands for the _MATH_-th block of _MATH_ and _MATH_ is searched within transform group. 
The above formulation is motivated by the observation that each character (hence subimage) is of low rank. 
Although _MATH_ should ideally correspond to a character, in practice it is not necessary to segment the region accurately. 
Only a rough estimate of the number of characters, which can be easily derived from the aspect ratio of the text region, is needed and _MATH_ can be obtained by equally partitioning the region. 
The readers can also find it in Supplementary Materials. 
The readers may refer to _CITE_ for how to derive the detailed optimization algorithms.
Trial-and-error (_CITE_) is a possible approach to learning and tackling with other cultures that can be considered in this book. 
This technique does not discuss something hypothetically, but defines concrete steps to approach to success. 
In trial-and-error, if a try was unsuccessful, experimental settings should be adjusted and the try repeated until the trial-and-error succeeds.
Errors in the sampling time, _MATH_, of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), triggered by the USO, produce a phase error indistinguishable from a change in separation. 
Since the additional instrumental phase noise detected by the phasemeter must be small compared to the design sensitivity, a noise level equivalent to a spacecraft displacement of _MATH_ is commonly allocated to the phase measurement system. 
This translates to a phase noise requirement of _MATHDISP_. 
The resulting USO timing fidelity requirement is beyond the performance of any feasible reference oscillator available for LISA _CITE_. 
Therefore, the phase noise of the USO used is not negligible and needs to be removed.
The role of color information in the recognition of non-face objects has been the subject of much debate. 
However, there has only been a small amount of work which examines its contribution to face recognition. 
Most of the work has only focused on the luminance structure of the face, thus ignoring color cues, due to several reasons.
Nota Bene: the particular case of the integral a) for _MATH_ and _MATH_ may be found in the Prudnikov et al.'s tables _CITE_. 
However, the provided expression is completely different and its numerical verification (performed with the help of Maple 12 and Matlab 7.2) fails _MATHDISP_ _CITE_. 
A careful study of this formula shows that the error consists in the misplaced square sign: _MATH_ should be replaced by _MATH_, that is to say _MATHDISP_ 
By the way, in a slightly different form the above formula appears in the so many times cited Malmsten's work _CITE_.
Note that the procedure, which is described below, has several specific features due to the presence of nonsmooth periodic functions. 
In particular, high-order approximations require a non-conventional interpretation for power series expansions; see the next subsection for the related remarks. 
Other modifications occur already in the leading order approximation.
We build multiple kernels noise _MATH_ by defining a given desired PSD _MATH_. 
The user may either directly define the PSD or he may paint a discrete sample of the desired spatial noise. 
In the latter case, a discrete mean _MATH_ is obtained by computing sets of FFTs using Welch's method. 
In what follows, we first describe a property regarding sums of independent noises. 
Next, we use this property to approximate an arbitrary PSD using a weighted sum of strictly positive functions, thus defining _MATH_ as a sum of independent convolution noises. 
Let us consider following sum of noises _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ _MATH_ are positive weights. 
We want to evaluate the PSD of _MATH_ according to the PSDs of the noises _MATH_. 
We use the Wiener-Khintchine theorem that states that the PSD of a signal _MATH_ is linked to the autocorrelation _MATH_ by the FT, i.e. _MATH_. 
The autocorrelation of a sum can be expressed as a sum of cross-correlations: _MATHDISP_ 
By definition, the cross-correlation of two independent random stationary signals is null. 
The cross-correlations _MATH_ are subsequently null. 
We obtain: _MATHDISP_ 
In other words, the PSD of a weighted sum of independent noises is the weighted sum of PSDs of these noises. 
We can exploit this property to approximate any multiple kernels noise _MATH_ by a convolution of random points with sets of different kernels _MATH_. 
By substituting _MATH_ in formula _REF_ by its definition (formula _REF_), we obtain: _MATHDISP_ 
Since all noises of this sum are based on a convolution with random points, we can further replace the double sum by a single convolution, thus defining multiple kernels noise as follows: _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_ being a uniform (equiprobable) random kernel index associated to _MATH_. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates an example of 1D PSD approximation with _MATH_ kernels. (a) represents the desired PSD. 
In 1D, it is defined as a decreasing linear ramp starting from frequency _MATH_ (a band-pass filtered pink noise). 
Its isotropic 2D extension is characterized by a ring. 
The second row of (a) shows the corresponding noise image obtained by computing a discrete inverse FFT. 
Note that it is a discrete noise image, not a noise function. 
The noises from (b) to (e), on the other hand, are infinite and continuous functions. (b) illustrates an approximation of the desired PSD using rectangular functions _MATH_. 
(c), (d) and (e) use Gaussians _MATH_ with increasing _MATH_. 
By assuming _MATH_ and _MATH_ (meaning that we neglect spectral errors), a multiple kernels noise function is obtained using formula _REF_ with _MATH_ (resp. _MATH_). 
The previously described property is well illustrated by this example. 
The convolution with random points leads to a PSD close to the desired one (see 2D PSDs on the right side). 
The visual quality of our noise approximation strongly depends on the chosen kernels and their parameters. 
As can be seen in the 1D chart (e), the Gaussian kernel, linked to Gabor-noise, provides a good approximation of the 1D linear ramp in spectral domain. 
But in spatial domain, the resulting noise (e) appears to be too noisy when compared to the reference noise image (a). 
The reason is that some energy is diffused towards undesired frequencies because the Gaussian does not fall off sufficiently rapidly on _MATH_. 
On the other hand, the approximation obtained using the rectangular kernels in (b) results in a multiple kernels noise function that visually better matches (a). 
In the case of Gabor-noise, it is possible to reduce the width of the Gaussians by increasing _MATH_, thus diffusing less energy. 
This is shown in parts (c) and (d). 
But when increasing too much _MATH_, as in (c), the global PSD approximation, and therefore the resulting noise, becomes less precise. 
An acceptable compromise is obtained for (d).
The exponential form assumes thermal emission from a static source. 
In heavy ion collisions, this is not correct due to the presence of radial flow, but eq. (_REF_) was nevertheless used by several experiments to fit the data. 
Since the _MATH_ distributions are not purely exponential, The _MATH_ extracted from an exponential fit will depend in general on the fitted _MATH_ range. 
It can be shown that, at first order, the _MATH_ value at low _MATH_ is given by _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the temperature at freeze-out, _MATH_ is the particle mass and _MATH_ is the average transverse velocity of the expanding source _CITE_. 
At high _MATH_, on the other hand, the _MATH_ extracted from the exponential fit is approximated by _MATH_ _CITE_. 
Thus, what is measured is a _MATH_ dependent effective temperature, larger than the freeze-out temperature because of the radial flow.
Given a physically realizable drawing, we consider the total order induced by each face _MATH_ from the arrangement. 
Given two disks _MATH_, we assume, w.l.g., that _MATH_ is above _MATH_. 
We then set _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
It clearly satisfies _REF_ as equality. 
For any three disks _MATH_, assuming _MATH_ is above _MATH_ and _MATH_ is above _MATH_, it is true that _MATH_ is above _MATH_ and thus such construction satisfies _REF_ for _MATH_. 
For pairs of disks _MATH_ that do not both belong to any _MATH_, we arbitrarily set _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Since, in this case, _MATH_ does not appear in _REF_, it is enough to observe that it satisfies _REF_ as equality. 
Given any visible arc _MATH_ from this drawing, its disk _MATH_ must be above all disks containing _MATH_, so setting _MATH_ will satisfy _REF_.
Another important result of our modeling is the duration (and length) increase of Moreton and EUV waves. 
This effect is also confirmed by observations (e.g., _CITE_; _CITE_). 
In contrast, a linear disturbance keeps its duration unchanged in a steady-state medium. 
Note that in the linear approximation, the wave amplitude and duration also vary due to the viscosity, the thermal conductivity and the finite plasma conductivity, however, these effects are negligible against nonlinear factors.
In Chapter _REF_ a number of examples and case studies will be developed by using QFT.
We first consider the case of a Dirac electron in an external electric field. 
We will obtain the block diagonal Hamiltonian to the second order in _MATH_ and compare with the FW transformation obtained in _CITE_. 
Note that contrary to the FW which is not an expansion in _MATH_, the new method is valid for strong external fields (actually a FW transformation expanded into a power series in _MATH_ was also recently proposed _CITE_).
As mentioned before, statically positioned match points do not follow the flow of a fluid simulation. 
We therefore advect the match points generated from the dart throwing algorithm through the velocity field of the low resolution preview simulation. 
We do not need to advect these particles by running a costly complete Lagrangian particle simulation. 
Instead, we simply use first order Eulerian integration to update the position of each match point with the velocity field _MATH_. 
More importantly, match points that follow Lagrangian particle physics are not necessarily aligned with prominent features because they have a much more scarce distribution and larger radii.
Regarding the performance of the rest of the stages (data exchange and disk write operation), Figs. _REF_ and _REF_ show the execution time for Myrinet and Fast Ethernet networks, respectively. 
Different _MATH_ values (called stride sizes) were used for fixed values of _MATH_ (300MB) and _MATH_. 
The execution time is divided into the three communication stages and the disk write access. 
Note that the amount of data exchanged does not depend on _MATH_. 
For this reason, the communication times are almost constant for all the phases and _MATH_ values. 
When Fast Ethernet communication network is used (PVFS filesystem keeps using Myrinet) there is a significant increment of the communication cost, but the algorithm performance does not degrade for different _MATH_ values. 
Based on these figures we can conclude that the performance of the executor does not depend on _MATH_. 
Note that our method shows similar performance in all the distribution scenarios (for different strides). 
As we will see in the following section, this does not occur with other techniques.
Direct observation of spinning motion is only possible if the rotation axis does not coincide with the symmetry axis or if substructures of an object can be resolved (e.g., Figure 3 in CT1). 
Pike and Mason (1998) have presented SoHO-CDS observations of what they call tornados and suggest that these are larger and spatially resolved versions of rotating H_MATH_ spicules. 
A multi-spacecraft observation of a rotating polar jet was communicated by Kamio et al. (2010, hereafter referred to as KC1). 
Recently, Wedemeyer-Bohm and van der Voort (2009) reported disk observations of 'chromospheric swirls' in CRISP Ca ii IR images. 
In all these cases the objects extended over tens of arcseconds. 
However, spinning motion down to scales near the resolution of modern space- or ground-based telescopes has recently also been reported by many observers (e.g., Nistico et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2011, Shen et al. 2011). 
Suematsu et al. (2008) have noted the oscillatory behaviour with a period of 1-1.5 min in Hinode-SOT images and have interpreted it as the spinning motion of the spicule as a rigid body.
In Fig 4, numerical simulations for the original system in the plane of _MATH_ are given. 
Six regions responding to the six regions in Fig 2 are divided. 
In regions I, the origin is stable. 
In regions II and III, there is a stable periodic solution with a frequency _MATH_ responding to the monomodal solution _MATH_ in the region II and III of Fig 2(a). 
In regions V and VI, a stable periodic solution with frequency _MATH_ responding to the monomodal solution _MATH_ in the region V and VI of Fig 2(a) exists. 
In region IV, a stable quasi-periodic solution exists. 
Obviously, the results of numerical simulations are in accord with those of the analysis in Fig 2.
The first-order predicate _MATH_ describes not only the _MATH_th process but also its environment (comprised of the _MATH_th process). 
_MATH_ is a quite detailed picture of the global system and all the snapshots are represented as _MATH_.
Figures _REF_ and _REF_ show periodmaps of the data cubes of the oscillatory event on the 14th of July, 1998, discussed in section _REF_, in 171 √Ö and 195 √Ö bandpasses, respectively. 
The analysed signals are the running differences of the original data cube smoothed by two points in the both spatial dimensions. 
As the periods of the detected oscillations is rather high, in the blue part of the spectrum, we process the maps with the use of the hist_equal function of IDL. 
This function returns a histogram-equalized byte array, which is then visualised with the use of tvscl. 
The transverse oscillations are clearly seen on both periodmaps as the extended regions of the same or similar colour in the parts of the map, which correspond to the boxes in the active region image shown in Figure _REF_. 
The oscillations are also well seen on the periodmaps constructed for the running differences of the original signal, without smoothing in spatial dimensions. 
Also, periodmaps of the original signal itself do show the oscillating regions, but they are less pronounced in this case.
In what follows, we need the notion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
If the equation _MATHDISP_ has a solution _MATH_ for some _MATH_, then _MATH_ is called eigenvalue and _MATH_ eigenvector of _MATH_. 
In other words, _MATH_ is the solution of the equation _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes again the unit matrix. 
For the existence of a nonzero solution _MATH_ it is necessary and sufficient that the matrix _MATH_ is not invertible, i.e., _MATHDISP_. 
By writing _MATHDISP_ we see that _MATH_ has to be a solution of the characteristic equation _MATHDISP_. 
If this equation has a real solution _MATH_, then the system of equations _MATH_ is underdetermined and thus has a nonzero solution _MATH_. 
Hence one obtains the eigenvectors to the eigenvalue _MATH_ by solving the linear system _MATHDISP_. 
Depending on whether the characteristic equation has two real, a double real or two complex conjugate solutions, we obtain one of the three similarity classes of _MATH_.
Using now the S-procedure, it follows that a sufficient condition for the satisfaction of condition (_REF_) is that, for some symmetric matrix _MATH_ with nonnegative entries and a nonnegative scalar _MATH_, the following inequality is verified _MATH_: _MATHDISP_
The derived kernel naturally defines a derived distance _MATH_ on the space of images via the equation _MATHDISP_. where we used the fact that normalization implies _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
Clearly, as the kernel "similarity" approaches its maximum value of 1, the distance goes to 0.
Take _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
By (_REF_) and (_REF_), we have _MATHDISP_. 
Furthermore, _MATHDISP_. 
For any _MATH_, when _MATH_ for some nonnegative integer _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
On the other hand, when _MATH_ for some nonnegative integer _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
By (_REF_) and (_REF_), we can get _MATHDISP_. 
It easy to get the following inequality _MATHDISP_, for some _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_. 
Then _MATHDISP_, and hence _MATHDISP_. 
Thus by Definition _REF_, it is easy to get NTNN (_REF_) is exponentially stabilizable via an intermittent state feedback controller like (_REF_). 
The proof is completed.
Suppose that the condition _MATH_ holds. 
Then for _MATH_, _MATH_ admits a unique weak solution _MATH_.
A horizontal twisted magnetic flux tube is located underneath the photosphere, along the _MATH_-axis. 
The tube is made buoyant through a density deficit that is maximum at the centre ( i.e. _MATH_) of the tube. 
More precisely, the density within the tube and along the _MATH_-axis follows the Gaussian profile: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the background density profile and _MATH_ is the density deficit and is negative. 
The density deficit is specified as: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the pressure and density of the background atmosphere, respectively. 
The tube is required to be in radial force balance with the external plasma. 
Therefore, the pressure deficit is: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field, which is defined as: _MATHDISP_, The twisted tube has an axial magnetic field component, _MATH_, which is given by a simple Gaussian profile _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the radial distance from the axis of the tube, initially located at a height _MATH_, which is equal to _MATH_ Mm in the present experiment and _MATH_ is the radius of the tube. 
The magnetic field strength on the axis of the tube is _MATH_ (_MATH_ gauss (G)). 
This field strength corresponds to a local plasma _MATH_ at the axis of the tube, with _MATH_ being the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure.
In Figure _REF_(a), we show the cashew setting one pixel of distance in the boundary simplification step. 
In Figure _REF_(b), shows the resulting quad mesh obtained from the triangulation depicted in Figure _REF_(a).
We can expand the deformation _MATH_ over this orthonormal basis set of eigenfunctions, _MATHDISP_, and then determine the coefficients by projecting _REF_ onto each eigenfunction: _MATHDISP_. 
Interestingly, the coefficient _MATH_ of the first excited bound state _MATH_ remains undetermined because _MATH_ of _MATH_ is exactly compensated by the _MATH_. 
In other words, this mode appears as a zero-energy eigenmode of the linear response kernel _CITE_. 
This has a simple, yet profound physical explanation: because _MATH_, the deformation _MATH_ simply shifts the center of mass by _MATH_. 
Thus we find, as argued in Sec. _REF_ above, that the soliton's center of mass is an independent dynamical variable that is influenced non-perturbatively by the external potential.
_MATH_ 
There exists _MATH_ and _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) JPEG _CITE_, named after the acronym of the group that in 1992 defined its standard, aims at significantly reducing the size of raster images, mainly of halftone pictures such as photographs, at the cost of a lower quality in enlargements. 
Indeed, it provides lossy compression and true color. 
It is ideal for efficient transmission and exploitation of images on the Web, even in the case of photographs including many details, which makes it the most widely known and spread raster format. 
However, it is not suitable for images that are to be modified, because each time the image is saved an additional compression is applied, and thus increasingly more information will be lost. 
In such a case, it is wise to save intermediate stages of the artifact in a lossless format. 
Meta-information cannot be embedded in the file.
When the location _MATH_ of the assembly station is fixed, the optimization of the variables _MATH_ amounts to solve the allocation subproblem _MATHDISP_ where the cost for providing component _MATH_ from production unit _MATH_ to the assembly station is given by _MATHDISP_ the constant term _MATH_ may be disregarded in the optimal choice of _MATH_, and the feasible region is given by _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ denotes the (fixed) total quantity of component _MATH_ needed to satisfy all demands.
Proof of Lemma _REF_: Set _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
By the assumptions the function _MATH_ belongs to _MATH_. 
Furthermore, for any _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
Consequently _MATH_ belongs to the polar cone _MATH_ of _MATH_. 
In view of statement _MATH_ in Lemma _REF_ the proof follows if we show that _MATH_ is orthogonal to _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is orthogonal to _MATH_ (see Bischoff and Hashorva (2005)) we have _MATHDISP_, hence the result follows.
GRT is only an approximate description of wave behaviour. 
It shares many of the flaws of standard MHD ray theory _CITE_, though not the gross error of presuming perfect fast-fast or slow-slow connectivity across _MATH_ (i.e., _MATH_). 
Specifically, it should be asymptotically correct in the high frequency limit, where wavelengths are vanishingly small compared to background inhomogeneity length scales. 
But how well does it perform in more realistic, moderate-frequency scenarios? 
In this paper, we test the accuracy of the GRT estimation of transmission coefficient _MATH_ in a simple, uniform-field, isothermal, gravitationally-stratified model for which exact wave solutions exist. 
Although not exhibiting all of the features that we may wish in a sunspot model, it does possess the most important characteristic - a rapidly increasing _MATH_ ratio with height - which allows for a meaningful and informative test.
The decision-making component of our model is very similar to the agent-based model for the nest site selection process of A. florea described in _CITE_, with two exceptions. 
_CITE_ allowed agents in the model (model A. florea bees) the ability to spontaneously mimic other bees' dances to observe the effects of allowing positive feedback on information that was not independently verified. 
Even with low probabilities of occurrence, mimicry had a strong effect on the decision-making process in simulations, reducing the average time for a swarm to make a decision substantially, with the drawback that errors could propagate through the system unchecked. 
Mimicry was included based on evidence of its possible occurrence in real A. florea swarms _CITE_. 
However, here we do not allow for dance mimicry for simplicity and because we know of no evidence of its occurrence in A. mellifera swarms. 
In addition, in _CITE_, model bees could enter a "surveyor" state where they remained dedicated to a particular site but had the option of changing their allegiance to another direction or stopping their dance activities completely based on observations of the dance behaviour of other bees on the swarm. 
The surveyor state was included in _CITE_ because real A. florea scouts tend to follow the dances of other bees in the swarm in between their own distinct bouts of dancing, see Fig. 1 of _CITE_. 
In some cases scouts switch the direction that they danced for after observing another bees dance _CITE_. 
_CITE_ found that the inclusion of the surveyor state and the potential for switching dance direction in simulations had minimal effect on the time to make a decision. 
A. mellifera is also known to switch dance direction occasionally _CITE_. 
However, field experiments have shown that the presence or absence of any dance direction switching has no significant effect on the time that it takes A. mellifera swarms to make a decision _CITE_. 
Given that switching dance direction does not seem to have a strong effect on the decision-making process in either species (based on simulations of A. florea and experiments with A. 
mellifera) we have excluded the surveyor state and the switching of dance direction from the model used here.
After a standby node is activated, DRA-SD determines which part of the current load is sent to the new active node. 
The load re-distribution policy follows the affinity-based routing algorithm. 
Suppose that _MATH_ is a new active node. 
DRA-SD performs the following procedure to allocate workload to _MATH_: 
For every AC, the front-end calculates the expected load after _MATH_ time units. 
Specifically, the expected load of _MATH_ is _MATH_. 
We call it _MATH_).
Similar results are obtained for the southern hemisphere: the sign of the imbalance always coincides with the sign of leading sunspots (Figure _REF_). 
Thus, positive difference corresponds to the time when leading sunspots in the given hemisphere have positive polarity. 
Re spectively, the negative difference corresponds to the period when leading sunspots have negative polarity. 
This effect can be observed for almost three solar cycles both for the northern and southern hemispheres of the Sun. 
It is seen that the imbalance of positive and negative fluxes in each of the solar hemispheres shows 22-year recurrence directly connected with the Hale cycle. 
Absolute values of the imbalance for both solar hemispheres [_MATH_] closely follow sunspot activity for Cycles 21 and 22 (Figures _REF_, _REF_). 
The correlation becomes somewhat poorer for Cycle 23, although the main effect can be observed in this case also: the change of the imbalance sign during solar minimum.
If _MATH_, the acceptance probability for the proposed state is _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_ 4. 
Update _MATH_ drawing from their conditional posterior distribution in (_REF_).
From this construction, an identity _MATHDISP_. in the projective limit _MATH_ gives immediately the identity _MATHDISP_. 
in all the centers of the group algebras _MATH_; this provides an easy proof of the theorem of Farahat and Higman. 
The same techniques and kind of results have been studied more recently by the author for product of Geck-Rouquier elements in the centers of the Hecke algebras _MATH_ of the symmetric groups (cf. _CITE_); and by O. Tout in _CITE_ for product of classes in the algebras _MATH_ associated to the Gelfand pairs _MATH_.
As we know the analytic expression of _MATH_ in the case of fixed _MATH_ or _MATH_ for the case of fixed _MATH_, and _MATH_, the only unknowns are _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Solving these system of two algebraic equations we obtain _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We show the results in Fig. _REF_, where we can see a decrease in the second order moments for both quark and gluon jets. 
The decreasing behavior is found for the two different cases that we analyze.
One can see on Fig._REF_ a scheme of an event with multiple interaction. 
Several ladders are exchanged in parallel. 
All ladders exist at the same time. 
The total energy is shared between ladders. 
This means that it's impossible to have an infinite number of ladder. 
The total energy is conserved. 
_MATH_ refers to the fraction of light cone momentum of the parton which enter the ladder.
As shown in Fig. _REF_, the example network consists of five nodes with identifiers a, b, c, d, e, f and _MATH_. 
In Round 1 which is the first odd numbered round, nodes send _MATH_ messages from their black copies to white copies of the neighbors. 
In Round 2, the _MATH_ messages are received resulting in nodes a, b, d and _MATH_ being matched which is a vertex cover with the same set of vertices. 
It should be noted that based on the arbitrary port numbering, node _MATH_ could have proposed to node _MATH_ first and we would have a minimum vertex cover of nodes b, c, d and _MATH_ in this case.
In this work ion implantation technique is used to implant cobalt ions into ZnO. 
There are two main purposes of this work. 
One is to produce ZnO-based ferromagnetic semiconductors which have _MATH_ values higher than room temperature. 
The second aim of the work is to shed some light on the origin of room temperature ferromagnetism whether it originates from clusters or from uniformly distributed magnetic cobalt atoms. 
In an attempt to fabricate ferromagnetic semiconductors, ZnO films are exposed to magnetic cobalt ions for varying implantation doses. 
Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to obtain Co distribution profiles and to identify possible second phases in these systems. 
The magnetic properties of the implanted materials have been investigated using the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and X-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) as well as X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). 
Hall effect measurements were also performed to determine the type of carriers in the Co-implanted ZnO films.
To derive the electric field strength in static coordinates we must still transform the vector indices. 
Substituting (_REF_) into expression (_REF_) gives, _MATHDISP_. 
We see that the one loop correction at fixed static coordinate _MATH_ (_REF_) has both the opposite sign and a much slower growth than the result in conformal coordinates (_REF_). 
The physical interpretation seems to be that the static coordinate observer experiences the logarithmic running of the electromagnetic coupling which is built into the Bunch-Davies vacuum, no matter what coordinate system one employs. 
The effect becomes nonperturbatively strong after about _MATH_ e-foldings.
Numerical calculation, for which the results are summarized in Table 1, shows that _MATH_. 
For the function _MATH_ we have: _MATH_ when _MATH_ and _MATH_ when _MATH_. 
Table 1. 
Calculated values
Corollary 4.3. 
Let (C1)-(C3) hold. 
Then, _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_.
The determinant condition for non-vanishing solutions _MATH_ yields the equation (note:_MATH_) _MATHDISP_
Subject to: _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ denotes the connect cost, _MATH_ presents the placement cost, _MATH_ is the control parameter which determines the participating degree of the connection cost on server deployment, _MATH_ denotes whether a potential location _MATH_ is selected to be deployed, _MATH_ denotes the cost for deploying unit server in region _MATH_, _MATH_ denotes whether peers in region _MATH_ are served by servers in region _MATH_, and _MATH_ denotes the connection cost (such as the latency) for peers in region _MATH_ to access servers in region _MATH_. 
Constraint (2) denotes that the total demand capacity from all deployed servers is no more than the expected total capacity and Constraint (3) expresses that peers in one region are served by servers deployed in a certain region.
We rescale the elastic field components _MATH_ and _MATH_, and the material coordinate _MATH_ by the beam length _MATH_, and time by the pretension _MATH_ to yield a coupled set of dimensionless partial differential equations for the beam-string: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Other dimensionless parameters include the effects of weak bending _MATH_, a strong nonlinear pretension _MATH_, a small slenderness ratio _MATH_ (because _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the beam-string radius of gyration _CITE_), and finite viscoelastic damping _MATH_: _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_ defines the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse wave speeds _CITE_. 
The rescaled parallel plate approximation is thus: _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_.
Crossing the phantom divide line in the Holographic dark energy model in a closed universe
Let us then assume in the following that the soliton's center of mass has reached a position such that the external potential does not accelerate it any more, namely that the right hand side of _REF_ for _MATH_ vanishes. 
A sufficient condition for this is that the external potential _MATH_ is (locally) an even function around the soliton position _MATH_. 
Then, the soliton shape deformation reads _MATHDISP_ with eq. _REF_ determining the coefficients _MATH_ and _MATH_ as linear functions of the external potential _MATH_, scaling by construction as _MATH_. 
In Sec. _REF_ below, we will study the scaling with the wave vector for a simple lattice potential.
It is, of course, not necessary to keep the _MATH_ ratio of subinterval lengths. 
For example, if there is a point _MATH_ such that _MATH_ is much greater than _MATH_, the halving, or any other kind of division, is natural be continued on _MATH_. 
This reminds us the idea used in the adaptive numerical methods with a variable step length.
Finally, the attitude synchronization scheme in Theorem _REF_ is implemented under the strongly connected directed graph _MATH_ given in Fig. _REF_. 
The communication delays are assumed constant and given by _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and the control gains are selected as in table _REF_. 
Also, the initial conditions of the virtual systems _REF_ and the auxiliary systems _REF_ are set similar to the previous example. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates the systems attitudes in this case. 
It can be seen that the leaderless attitude synchronization is achieved without angular velocity measurements for any arbitrary constant communication delays.
A prism is a convex polytope isometric to the lower hull of three non-collinear points in _MATH_. 
We use the term "prism" not in its usual meaning: the lateral edges of our prism are necessarily orthogonal to the lower base, but the upper base need not be parallel to it. 
Up to isometry, a prism is uniquely determined by a Euclidean triangle _MATH_ isometric to its upper base, and by three non-negative heights _MATH_, which are the lengths of the lateral edges. 
Note that a height may equal 0.
Of course, the solar atmosphere has a complex surface magnetic field. 
Even potential field extrapolations, of the measured magnetic flux at photospheric heights, would result in complex geometric structures outlined by the field lines. 
However, the uniform field is an excellent tool and a working model to investigate the behaviour of the MHD modes. 
The magnetic field in our simulations is exactly vertical, which makes the analysis of the wave processes easier, because components of the field perturbations transverse and parallel to the background magnetic field coincide with the horizontal and vertical velocity components in the computational domain. 
Vertical drivers introduced in our simulations generate both slow and fast types of magnetic wave modes. 
We address the following questions: which mode can penetrate into the lower corona? 
How are the modes coupled? 
How/Can modes transfer energy from the temperature minimum to the upper chromosphere and the lower corona? 
And, last but not least, these simulations are useful to test the code in 3D MHD.
In this Appendix we present a derivation of perturbation equation _REF_. 
Obtaining this equation is made somewhat more involved by the fact that the perturbation variable _MATH_ is itself a function of the state magnitude, i.e., _MATH_. 
We assume here that only _MATH_ is perturbed while _MATH_ remains fixed, with the opposite case leading to essentially the same calculations. 
By substituting, respectively, _MATH_ and _MATH_ into equation _REF_, we obtain _MATH_ and _MATH_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the corresponding solutions and _MATH_, _MATH_. 
Taking the difference of these two equations and defining _MATH_. 
we obtain _MATHDISP_, where we also set _MATH_ in the first term on the RHS. 
As regards the terms denoted _MATH_ in _REF_, they are transformed as follows using the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals and the change of variables _MATH_ for _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, where we also denoted _MATH_. 
The integrand expression on the RHS in _REF_ is then expanded in the Taylor series around _MATH_ _MATHDISP_, where the component notation was used for clarity with _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ denoting the components of vectors _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Plugging expansion _REF_ into expression _REF_ we obtain _MATHDISP_. 
Noting that term _MATH_ in _REF_ transforms in an analogous way to _MATH_ in _REF_-_REF_, using these results in _REF_, assuming smallness of _MATH_ and dropping terms of order quadratic and higher we finally arrive at perturbation equation _REF_.
Next, we will present a convergence proof of the iteration between (_REF_) and (_REF_) with the value function _MATH_ and the control law _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
Before that, we will see what _MATH_ will be when it is expanded. 
According to (_REF_) and (_REF_), we can obtain _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Then, we have _MATHDISP_, which can also be written as _MATHDISP_ when using the notation in (_REF_). 
These equations will be useful in the convergence proof of the iterative ADP algorithm.
We differentiate between two different visualization strategies: interactive visualization is designed for very short response times, e.g., a fast validation of a segmentation result, while high quality visualization focuses only on the quality of the resulting image. 
Furthermore we distinguish between methods that visualize only the original topographical data (raw data), those that use already identified structure/segment information and methods that use both informations to generate a visual impression.
For the two pulsars, the fitted scattering strength values of the thin screen are both much bigger than that of the extended medium. 
This may indicate that much denser regions exist with enhanced scattering along the LOS, and that the scattering of the thin screen dominates.
In this subsection we give estimates for remainder terms in the stochastic Taylor-like expansion. 
We keep the same notations as in the previous subsection. 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_ is clearly well-defined. 
We prove that the correspondence _MATH_ extends to a continuous map from _MATH_ to _MATH_ and that _MATH_ is a term of "order _MATH_".
It is well-known and classical (see, e.g., the text _CITE_) that for parametric right hand sides _MATH_ which are Lipschitz continuous with respect to _MATH_ and which depend analytically on the parameters _MATH_, the solution _MATH_ in turn depends analytically on the parameter vector _MATH_. 
This local analytic dependence of the solutions on the parameters is, in fact, a quite generic phenomenon which appears in many systems with analytic, nondegenerate parameter dependence as a consequence of (a suitable version of) the implicit function theorem (see, e.g., _CITE_). 
In the present paper, we extend the proof in _CITE_ of this (classical) result to a possibly countable number of parameters with quantitative bounds on the size of domains of analyticity. 
This mathematical result will be used to establish best _MATH_-term convergence rates for various parametric expansions of the solution _MATH_ under a sparsity hypothesis on the vector field _MATH_ in _REF_. 
Our main result is that dimension-independent rates of best _MATH_-term approximation are achievable with _MATH_-term truncated Taylor expansions of the solution _MATH_ in the parameter space _MATH_. 
In the present paper, we establish for several types of expansions the uniform and unconditional convergence for all _MATH_ belonging to an infinite-dimensional parameter domain _MATH_. 
Moreover, we establish that sparsity in the input vector field _MATH_ implies, for example, sparsity (in a sense to be made precise below) in the parametric solutions' formal Taylor-expansions, i.e., _MATHDISP_. 
We prove analogous results also for other polynomial expansions of the solution, such as Legendre or Chebyshev expansions.
Next result shows that the formal power series, (i.e, generating function) for _MATH_-Meixner-Sobolev orthogonal polynomials can be reduced to a formal power series involving Meixner polynomials.
Next we apply a framework for dynamic scaling of roughened interfaces to advance a new perspective on invasion ecology. 
To analyze roughening we define the "width" of the invading front via: _MATHDISP_, Of course, _MATH_ is itself a fluctuating quantity, so in simulations we estimate an ensemble average over different runs, or take an average over a time series in steady state, to obtain _MATH_. 
Hereafter, we let _MATH_, for convenience, and write _MATH_. 
Without creating confusion, we shall use the notation _MATH_, to refer to the typical size of the interface region.
In view of Fubini's theorem, the valuation of options which can be represented like this boils down to the computation of the Laplace transform of the underlying. E.g., for the put on quadratic variation we have _MATHDISP_. 
Using the put-call parity _MATH_, this leads to the analogous formula _MATHDISP_ for calls on variance, provided that _MATH_ is integrable. 
Evidently, one just has to replace the normalized quadratic variation _MATH_ by _MATH_ to come up with the corresponding formulas for options on discretely sampled realized variance. 
Summing up, it remains to compute the Laplace transforms of the objects of interest.
Then _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Now, if _MATH_, in particular we have for _MATH_ and _MATH_, that _MATHDISP_, dividing by _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively, and letting _MATH_ we get that _MATH_. 
So _MATH_. 
Finally the lsc of _MATH_ at _MATH_ gives that _MATH_.
Assuming now that the power of the solution of (_REF_) is _MATH_, by using (_REF_) and (_REF_) we get from (_REF_), that _MATH_ satisfies the inequality _MATHDISP_. 
The algebraic equation (_REF_) considered for _MATH_, has exactly one positive root _MATH_. 
Then, comparison of the equation (_REF_) with inequality (_REF_), implies that the power _MATH_ must satisfy the lower bound (_REF_).
The average intensity of the range block which is a number between 0 and 255.
_MATH_ 
If there exist functions _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ such that the following estimate holds for all _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ then, we say that _MATH_ satisfies the Input-to-Output Stability (IOS) property from the input _MATH_ with gain _MATH_. 
Moreover, if _MATH_, then we say that _MATH_ satisfies the Uniform Input-to-Output Stability (UIOS) property from the input _MATH_ with gain _MATH_.
The results in this section can be considered as the extension of the state-feedback attitude synchronization schemes presented in Section _REF_ to account for time-varying communication delays. 
Using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, a sufficient condition for synchronization, given in _REF_, is derived. 
This condition relates the controller gains and the upper bound of the time-varying communication delays. 
In addition, in the case of Theorem _REF_, attitude synchronization is achieved under the condition that the undirected communication graph is a tree, while cooperative attitude tracking, Theorem _REF_, is achieved for any undirected graph provided that the control gains satisfy condition _REF_. 
These restrictions are the same obtained in the results of Chapter _REF_, and are mainly due to the nonlinear expression of the relative attitudes defined using the unit-quaternion multiplication.
Due to Lemma _REF_, (_REF_)-(_REF_), the derivatives of _MATH_ (_MATH_) along the trajectory of (_REF_) are: _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
For the functions _MATH_, _MATH_, using _MATH_ we get that _MATHDISP_.
The point source unfolding cuts the cut locus of the point _MATH_: the closure of the set of all those points _MATH_ to which there is more than one shortest path on _MATH_ from _MATH_. 
The notion of cut locus was introduced by Poincare _CITE_ in 1905, and since then has gained an important place in global Riemannian geometry; see, e.g., _CITE_ or _CITE_. 
The point source unfolding has been studied for polyhedral convex surfaces since _CITE_ (where the cut locus is called the "ridge tree").
The above point is true both in the supervised and unsupervised setting, in that the description complexity of topology is overwhelming (with a phase transition in dimension 3 for non-singular situations).
The aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic properties and oscillation of the n-th order advanced differential equations _MATHDISP_ 
The results obtained are based on the Riccati transformation.
A remarkable fact about the inflationary scenario is that it contains a natural mechanism which gives rise to perturbations for any field. 
It is important for our aims that such a mechanism provides also a distinctive spectrum for relic scalar GWs. 
These perturbations, in inflationary cosmology, arise from the most basic quantum mechanical effect: the uncertainty principle. 
In this way, the spectrum of relic GWs that we could detect today is nothing else but the adiabatically-amplified zero-point fluctuations _CITE_. 
The calculation for a simple inflationary model can be performed for the scalar field component. 
Let us assume that the early Universe is described by an inflationary de Sitter phase emerging in a radiation dominated phase _CITE_. 
The conformal metric element is _MATHDISP_, where, for a purely scalar GW the metric perturbation (_REF_) reduces to _MATHDISP_. 
Let us assume a phase transition between a de Sitter and a radiation-dominated phase _CITE_, we have: _MATH_ is the inflation-radiation transition conformal time and _MATH_ is the value of conformal time today. 
If we express the scale factor in terms of comoving time _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ for the de Sitter and radiation phases respectively. 
In order to solve the horizon and flatness problems, the condition _MATH_ has to be satisfied. 
The relic scalar-tensor GWs are the weak perturbations _MATH_ of the metric (_REF_) which can be written in the form _MATHDISP_, in terms of the conformal time _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a constant wave-vector. 
From Eqs. (_REF_) and (_REF_), the scalar component is _MATHDISP_, where we have specified the amplitude and the phase to the cosmological case. 
Assuming _MATH_, from the Klein-Gordon equation in the FRW metric, one gets _MATHDISP_ where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time. 
The solutions of Eq. (_REF_) can be expressed in terms of Hankel functions in both the inflationary and radiation dominated eras, that is:
Thus, _MATH_ does not look too promising compared to _MATH_. 
In particular, due to the larger mask support and the appearance of negative mask coefficients _MATH_, normal MT with _MATH_ is not always well-defined. 
Table _REF_ shows that nevertheless the detail decay in normal MT with _MATH_ is slightly faster than with _MATH_. 
In the first two rows, we show the predicted decay exponents for normal MT with _MATH_ using least-squares fits, in the first row based on _MATH_ as used before, in the second based on a more sophisticated ansatz _MATH_ containing additional _MATH_ terms. 
The latter is modeled after possible asymptotics _MATH_, compare _CITE_. 
Experimentally we observe that approximately _MATH_ instead of _MATH_ for smooth enough _MATH_. 
The appearance of a factor _MATH_ in the exponent is in agreement with the decay rate predicted by Theorem _REF_.
Surface Vessel Control: 
The surface vessel subjected to disturbance _REF_ is simulated under the action of backstepping control _REF_ with control gains _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The position, control and disturbance on the surface vessel are shown in Fig. _REF_, where it can be observed that the backstepping control is able to position the vessel near its desired position at the origin.
We first write 1-loop electron self-energy using the UVDP parametrization, rather than the Feynman parametrization like we did in Sec._REF_. 
The reason lies in the fact that this time the one-loop electron self-energy appears as the subdiagram in _MATH_ and may contribute to the overlapping divergence in the following calculation, _MATHDISP_, By inserting the above result into the expression of one-loop photon vacuum polarization diagram, we obtain: _MATHDISP_. 
Note that we have used the usual Feynman parameter _MATH_ to combine the denominators involving _MATH_ only, rather than combine all of the three factors once at all. 
This transforms the Feynman integral _MATH_ into the _MATH_-like integrals (we have already combine two factors in Eq.(_REF_) with UVDP parameter _MATH_ ). 
The advantage of this procedure is that it effectively separates the UV divergences from the IR ones in the parameter space. 
To see this more explicitly, our first paper_CITE_ already explicitly showed that the _MATH_ integrals contain the most general UV divergence structure. 
In other words, the UV divergence can only be contained in _MATH_ integrals and their corresponding UVDP parameter integrals, rather in the Feynman parameter space. 
If we find some divergence in integrating Feynman parameter _MATH_, then it must be the IR divergence, rather than the UV one. 
Since we have already written the integral into a generalized _MATH_ form, for the rest factors, we will apply the UVDP parameters to combine them, _MATHDISP_, Note also that, in the above calculation, we used the traditional technique of completing squares for each internal loop momentum and then shifting the origin of it in order to eliminate the terms linear in the momenta. 
The resulting formula appears less symmetric in the UVDP variables than that with the general formulae in Ref._CITE_. 
However, this traditional method is more flexible and more natural in practice when the numerator is a complicated function of internal and external momenta like the present case, rather than a constant for the scalar integrals. 
In the following calculation of Fig. (_REF_), we will also use this traditional method.
Note that since the opening angle of the V groove is 90_MATH_ and the PC lattice has square-type, the angle between the two split beams is also 90_MATH_ before they exit the PCW, as shown in Fig. _REF_. 
Interferences among split beams at the PCW exit are introduced and modified when rods are added or re-organized so that diverging angles among split beams change. 
In Figs. _REF_(a) and _REF_(a), the diverging angle between the two split beams is about 60_MATH_.
In general, each data structure presents unique problems for the estimation of reliability, but longitudinal data, with their different sources of variation and correlation, present some of the most challenging problems for defining and estimating reliability. 
An important attempt to extend the concept of reliability to a longitudinal setting was done using generalizability theory (from now referred to as G-theory). 
G-theory was developed by Cronbach et al (1972) to explicitly model the multiple sources of variation present in a measurement system. 
It is undoubtedly one of the most relevant developments in the psychometric field over the last 40 years and since its introduction G-theory has grown steadily in popularity and has been applied to virtually all areas of psychology and education. 
The basic mathematical model on which G-theory is based, the analysis-of-variance model with random effects, is quite solid. 
However, the utility of G-theory to evaluate reliability in longitudinal studies depends on the adequacy of this model to describe the specific data structure encountered. 
Unfortunately, the G-theory modeling framework can be applied to a longitudinal setting only if strong and unrealistic assumptions are made. 
For instance, we will need to assume stability of the true scores over time, uncorrelated error structure, uncorrelated random effects, equal variance over time and, in its most classical formulation, it will also require a missing completely at random mechanism when data are incomplete. 
All the previous assumptions are quite restrictive for longitudinal studies, limiting the applicability of G-theory. 
Applying G-theory models in a setting where these assumptions are violated will lead to biased estimates of the variance components and, as a consequence, to biased estimates of the G coefficients (Diggle, Liang, and Zeger 1994, Verbeke and Molenberghs 2000, Smith and Luecht 1992, Bost 1995, Molenberghs and Kenward 2007).
However, our proposal is different from _CITE_ in that shader threads are not explicitly microtriangles but tightly selected fragment candidates to hit in the microtriangle edge limits. 
This is a major difference in our approach that allows rasterizing both small-but-larger-than-one-pixel triangles and sub-pixel size triangles not perfectly aligned to pixel boundaries, that can cover up to 4 neighboring pixels. 
Both types of small triangles are much more expected as output of GPU tessellators. 
An ideal triangle-to-pixel perfect tessellation does not exist yet and it is only closely approximated in the REYES rendering architecture _CITE_, where high-definition primitives are diced to fit approximately in one screen pixel.
_MATH_ 
According to (1.3) the method _MATH_ seems to be related to the Cesaro method _MATH_. 
In fact the method _MATH_ can be replaced in this definition by any other regular matrix method _MATH_ satisfying certain conditions.
We will fix such an _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, set _MATH_ (the projection onto the _MATH_-component) and _MATH_. 
For _MATH_, set _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_. 
Then, from (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
The sum is over such _MATH_'s. 
From (_REF_) and the assumption of induction, we easily see that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
Combining this with Lemma _REF_, we have that _MATHDISP_, Next we estimate _MATH_-component of _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
For that purpose, it is sufficient to estimate _MATH_ in (_REF_) for _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, _MATH_th component of _MATH_ (that is equal to _MATH_ for the projection _MATH_) vanishes. 
From Lemma _REF_, the _MATH_th component _MATH_ satisfies the following: for _MATH_ as above, _MATHDISP_. 
Here, the left hand side is regarded as a multilinear map from _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, then the left hand side vanish.
From the analysis above, we see that although there are not point to point correspondence between the initial brightenings of flare kernels and the sites with high intensities of _MATH_, the former are roughly located near the inversion lines where the latter are. 
The flare brightenings are due to the release of free energy in the upper atmosphere. 
The electric field _MATH_ in the photosphere represents the foot-point winding motion which relates to the changes of the structure of the magnetic fields, and thus relates to the changes of the non-potentiality in the photosphere. 
So the results above imply that _MATH_ relates to the transportation of non-potentiality from the photosphere to the corona for the cases we studied.
Let _MATH_, _MATH_ be the optical signal and noise power at the input (Tx) of a point-to-point optical link with _MATH_ spans and amplifiers in gain control mode. 
Under Assumption _REF_ the optical signal power _MATH_, noise power _MATH_ and the OSNR at Rx _MATH_ (_REF_) are given in vector form as _MATHDISP_. and _MATHDISP_. where _MATH_ is transmission up to span _MATH_, (_REF_), _MATH_ is the link transmission, and _MATH_ denotes the diagonal matrix with the elements of vector _MATH_ as diagonal entries.
In Hinode-SOT Ca ii filtergraph data spicules often show a double structure with a separation of less than an arcsec. 
In an initial study, Suematsu et al. (2008) have reported that over 50% of spicules they observed show a double structure. 
They have concluded that such double-threaded features clearly seen in their Figures 2 and 3 must be spinning as a rigid body. 
Similarly, Sterling et al. (2010) suspect that the double structure in spicular features is the result of a spinning motion. 
They also suggest a concept of spicules being miniature EUV jets that feed the corona. 
This is in line with the observation of a double-threaded X-ray jet associated with the rotating macrospicule shown in Figure 2. 
This event is much larger than the events discussed in CT1. 
We show it, since in this case the bifurcation can definitively be associated with the rotation of the jet's hot skin. 
We suggest-similar to Pike and Mason (1998), Innes (2004) and others-that this scenario can be scaled down to sizes at or below the resolution limit of today's instruments and should be interpreted as a larger version of the same phenomenon. 
We are not aware of any physical reason for a lower limit of spicular features, which should allow us to interpret our observation as if we were observing with a magnifying glass and to suggest that they also rotate at subresolution scales, although we have no conclusive evidence for this.
Conditions (iii) and (iv) are added only for reference: (iii) allows for the comparison with the assertions on the mesh regularity indicator function _MATH_ used in _CITE_, (iv) is useful to replace arc-length related assumptions by assumptions on the point sets _MATH_ directly. 
The restriction _MATH_ is needed only for the equivalence of (iv) with the remaining statements, for the equivalence of (i), (ii), and (iii), _MATH_ is enough. 
The equivalence of (i) and (ii) is easy to show. 
If (i) holds, we use the identity _MATHDISP_, where we choose _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
A similar identity holds for _MATH_. 
Thus, with a constant _MATH_ depending only on the length of the index interval _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_ for any two indices _MATH_. 
This is (ii) with _MATH_. 
If (ii) holds then _MATH_ for any _MATH_, which yields (i) with _MATH_.
Solving the subproblem _MATHDISP_ is actually not always easy. 
When _MATH_ is separable, e.g., _MATH_, where _MATH_, we may solve this subproblem by minimizing over _MATH_ and _MATH_ alternately until convergence. 
However, in the case that _MATH_ is convex and _MATH_ is a linear function of _MATH_, the ADM only requires updating _MATH_ and _MATH_ only once and it can still be proven that the iteration converges to the optimal solution _CITE_. 
The ADM for two variables is outlined as Algorithm _REF_. 
The generalization to the multi-variable and multi-constraint case is straightforward.
A stochastic process _MATH_ is stable if there are an infinite number of negative and positive subscripts _MATH_ such that _MATH_.
In Fig. _REF_b we sketch the shock formation associated with a variable reconnection rate. 
The propagation of a large-amplitude wave along the current sheet, related to the change of reconnection rate, was anticipated by Volonskaya et al. (_CITE_). 
Recently, such a wave was revealed in the numerical simulation by Barta et al. (_CITE_). 
However, we note that while such quasi-longitudinal shocks could explain type II bursts, it is not likely that they could create Moreton waves, since the flanks of the shock probably do not reach the chromospheric layers (see Fig. 3 of Barta et al., _CITE_). 
Finally, we recall numerical experiments by Forbes (_CITE_) and Karlicky (_CITE_), where quasi-perpendicular fast-mode shocks were launched directly from the diffusion region after the onset of the fast reconnection stage.
Since _MATH_ is a positive solution of _REF_, then it follows from _REF_ that _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, _MATH_ is decreasing, which implies that either _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
But the case _MATH_ implies _MATH_. 
An integration from _MATH_ to _MATH_ yields _MATHDISP_, but in view of _REF_ _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Repeating this procedure, we obtain, that _MATH_ and this is a contradiction and, we conclude, that _MATH_. 
Moreover, _MATH_ implies that either _MATH_ or _MATH_ but the first case leads to _MATH_ for _MATH_. 
Repeating these considerations we verify that _MATH_ satisfies either _REF_ or _REF_.
The policies were evaluated under the average cost criterion. 
For each policy and parameter setting, a simulation was developed consisting of 60 (consecutive) runs, plus an additional run at the the beginning as a warm-up period. 
Each run had a length of 100,000 time units. 
The optimal policy for the proxy model was determined using a truncated state space with capacity _MATH_ customers per queue. 
Unless stated otherwise, LB refers to the smoothing approach.
In this article we investigate the radio emission during the late gradual phase of the previously analyzed event. 
The work is based on 40-400 MHz dynamic spectra ( Radio Spectrograph Observatorium Tremsdorf, Leibniz Institut fur Astrophysik Potsdam, AIP) combined with radio images obtained by the French Nancay Multifrequency Radio Heliograph (NRH) of the Observatoire de Paris, Meudon. 
Additionally we use Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) hard X-ray (HXR) flux records, and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) and Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) images.
Analysis of Subsequences and their frequency in a class
For a given disk _MATH_, the right hand side of _REF_ is _MATH_, as defined in Sect. _REF_. 
If _MATH_ satisfies _REF_ and the objective function is set to maximize _MATH_, we obtain _MATH_, which is the Max-Min metric.
Our model, although a simplified one, enabled us to study the role of major factors and to estimate the necessity of taking them into account. 
For example, with the particles reaching high temperatures even at moderate intensities one has to take into consideration their evaporation. 
High temperatures of electrons make it obvious that their thermoemission should also be taken into account.
Proof: 
From the features of the sliding mode observer designed in Section 3, it follows that in finite time the error dynamics (_REF_)-(_REF_) will be driven to the sliding surface (_REF_), and a sliding motion is maintained thereafter. 
During the sliding motion _MATHDISP_ 
Then, we can obtain _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ denotes the equivalent output error injection signal required to maintain the sliding motion _CITE_. 
The approach given in _CITE_ can be employed to produce the _MATH_. 
From (_REF_), the equivalent state error injection signal _MATH_ in (_REF_) can be approximated by _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are both positive constants.
The 'application agent' contacts the 'system control agent' and sends a tree overlay identifier. 
The self-organisation for this overlay terminates and all the information related to this overlay is removed from the 'self-organisation agent'.
In either case, the voltage gated channels can open only during a certain time period _MATH_ (system (_REF_) is considered with _MATH_ present). 
At the end of this transition process, the flytrap reaches a state _MATH_ that remains in the stability region _MATH_ of the open state but may be very close to the semi-closed state _MATH_ as _MATH_. 
When _MATH_, the large value of _MATH_ leads to large water supply rate _MATH_ to the inner layer, causing the water supply _MATH_ to compete with the hydraulic effect _MATH_. 
Such a competition creates another state _MATH_ and its emergence produces a barrier preventing the transition from open to semi-closed states. 
Thus the capture process will reach a limiting state, which is away from _MATH_ with distance _MATH_. 
In this scenario, no matter how long the opening period _MATH_ is, the flytrap always stays away from _MATH_ with a distance larger than _MATH_.
Female _MATH_ will choose the partnered state if and only if _MATH_. 
Taking the difference and adding an stochastic utility component the utility difference can be written as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and where I used that _MATH_. 
Assuming that the error term _MATH_ is normally distributed the model can then be estimated as simple probit model (see Eissa and Hoynes, 2003).
Theorem 4.1. 
Suppose _MATH_ and Assumption (H) is satisfied. 
Assume that _MATH_ is a positive root of (4.1) defined for _MATH_, and at some _MATH_, _MATH_ for some _MATH_. 
Then a pair of simple conjugate pure imaginary roots _MATH_ exists at _MATH_ which crosses the imaginary axis from left to right if _MATH_ and crosses the imaginary axis from right to left if _MATH_, where _MATHDISP_ 5. 
Numerical simulation
Now we assume the statement of the theorem is true for _MATH_, and will prove the case for _MATH_. 
First we give estimates for the first term on the right hand side of (_REF_). 
Slightly modifying the definition of _MATH_, we set _MATH_. 
We also set _MATHDISP_. 
Then, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Here, _MATH_ is defined by _MATHDISP_. 
We now consider _MATH_.
This is a very important problem of inflation to explain seminal magnetic fields. 
The possibility to solve this problem relies in produce non-trivial magnetic fields in which conformal invariance to be broken. 
The conformal invariance of Maxwell equations in four dimensions can also be broken if an embedding into a higher dimensional space-time with time-varying extra spatial dimensions is considered. 
In particular, in Brane Worlds or Induced Matter theory conformal invariance is naturally broken, which make possible the super adiabatic amplification of electric and magnetic field modes during the early inflationary epoch of the universe on cosmological scales.
A wide range of models can be used for the smooth part of the price process, with the usual trade-off between analytical tractability versus capturing realistic features. 
The most important stylized facts we would like to include in a model are the fluctuations of the volatility, the seasonalities and the fat-tailed distributions for the return and innovations. 
On the mathematical side, a convergence to continuous paths with an increasing tick density together with the micro-structure model _REF_ allows for some powerfull analytical results for various estimators of the volatility. 
But the convergence to continuous path restricts the choice of the process essentially to Gaussian processes with stochastic volatility. 
Finally, the processes can be written either using a regular (business) time grid, or using a random tick times with a specific process for the arrival of ticks. 
For practical applications, the behavior of the proposed estimators should also be studied ideally in the presence of outliers and possible gaps in the data. 
All these possibilities lead to a broad range of models and results, studied in numerous articles. 
A few major topics are introduced in the following sections, and the interested reader should consult the original literature or some reviews for an in-depth treatment. 
A good review of the realized volatility is given in _CITE_.
the objects of this category are (here '_MATH_' is the set difference):
We can see in above definitions that the bounded-input bounded-output property holds globally for ISS, while for SGP-ISS and SGP-DISS, the bounds of the solution of hybrid systems are not only determined by the properties of disturbances signals but also on the parameter _MATH_. 
Moreover, by tuning the parameter _MATH_, which depends on the bound of norm of input signals for SGP-ISS and depends on the bound of norm of input signals with their derivatives for SGP-DISS, the estimate of the domain of attraction for system _MATH_ can be arbitrarily enlarged.
We are in the case _MATH_, which means that _MATH_ pairs _MATH_ and _MATH_ need to be connected. 
We mark each subcube _MATH_ with _MATH_ as a fault, and define _MATH_ the set of faulty subcubes. 
So there are at most _MATH_ faults. 
If only one subcube is marked as a fault, then both _MATH_ and _MATH_ hold, so we can apply Lemma _REF_ in Step 2 of the algorithm of Section _REF_.
The wheeled structure moving outside the tank consists of a differential drive robot. 
The size of this part of the robot is _MATH_ (width, length, height). 
The two active wheels of the robot are actuated by two independent servo motors modified for continuous rotation. 
In particular, we used ZS-F135 sub-micro servo-motors with the following specifications: speed _MATH_ at 4.8 V; torque 1.2 kg cm at 4.8 V; weight 8 g, size _MATH_. 
The robot is powered by three 1.5 V batteries. 
The robot is equipped with a microcontroller AVR Atmega162 which receives control signals from a PC and generates the two PWM signals needed to control the servo motors. 
The communication between PC and robot is implemented through a ZigBee wireless protocol with XBee ZigBee/Mesh RF modules.
The heat transfer results are shown in Figs. _REF_(a) and (b) for different values of the wave amplitude _MATH_. 
The local Nusselt number _MATH_ remains smooth and increases with _MATH_ for the plane surface (_MATH_). 
For the wavy surface (_MATH_) the local Nusselt number fluctuates over every cycle and these fluctuations rise as _MATH_ increases. 
The fluctuations in the local Nusselt number increase with the wave amplitude. 
The mean Nusselt number _MATH_ increases with the stream position _MATH_ and with increasing amplitude values.
Because the metric has the killing vectors _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, we can take the ansatz of scalar field as _MATHDISP_. 
Substituting this ansatz into the wave equation (_REF_) and separating the variables, we can get the angular equation _MATHDISP_, and the radial equation _MATHDISP_.
(i) The _MATH_-d'Alembert equation is an extended crystal PDE for any _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ is _MATH_-connected, _MATH_, it becomes an extended 0-crystal iff _MATH_. 
In particular for _MATH_ it becomes a 0-crystal.
Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusion can be drawn: adult myogenic stem cell adhesion and viability tests on polymeric substrates show that the selected laser 3D microstructurable materials ORMOCORE b59, SZ2080 and PEG-DA-258 are applicable for biomedical practice (AKRE23 slightly less). 
It is supported by in vivo biocompatibility tests for these polymer materials implanted in living organism. 
The obtained results are encouraging for future work.
In order to investigate the basic principle of achromaticity for QWR, we examined the phase change _MATH_ and _MATH_ occurring on the interface of reflection for TE and TM waves respectively. 
As we all know, metal-strip grating with subwavelength period is almost transparent for TM wave and opaque for TE wave. 
Therefore, the QWR proposed here could be approximated as two grounded slab, one for TE wave and the other for TM, with different refractive index and different slab thickness. 
For simplicity, we started our investigation on a single grounded slab for both, with the same relative permittivity _MATH_ and the same thickness _MATH_. 
The incidence angle _MATH_ is assumed to be _MATH_. 
Using TL theory, we obtained the spectra of phase change _MATH_ and _MATH_ shown in Fig. 4. 
Obviously, both of them exhibit oscillation character with the same cycle. 
Moreover, we found that the balance line of those oscillating curves happens to be the phase change of the first order reflection _MATH_ as the function of frequency, which is written as _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the wavelength in free space, _MATH_ is the refraction angle. 
Hence, it is reasonable to attribute this kind of oscillation to the interference of multi-order reflections, which is also called the Fabry-Perot interference _CITE_. 
To realize the achromaticity, we need to keep the phase retardation _MATH_ invariant over a certain frequency range, which means that the spectra of _MATH_ and _MATH_ should have different amplitudes but the same slope. 
If we only take into account the first order reflection, obviously from equ. 
(13), the requirement for achromaticity will never be fulfilled. 
Thanks to the oscillation character induced by Fabry-Perot interference, by choosing both proper _MATH_ and proper _MATH_ for TE and TM wave respectively, the requirement could be achieved thus the achromatic phase retarder could be realized. 
That's the basic principle of achromaticity of QWR proposed in this paper. 
However, it is not right to investigate the QWR just through the simple approximated grounded slab, since the subwavelength metal-strip grating for TE wave is not absolutely opaque. 
Take the corresponding SWG of optimized QWR in Fig. 2 for example, the transmission of TE wave at 2.8THz is above 5%.
We defined the notation _MATHDISP_ to mean "_MATH_ belongs to _MATH_" or "_MATH_ is an element of _MATH_," and _MATH_ to mean _MATH_ is a subset of _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ we also say that _MATH_ contains _MATH_ or _MATH_ is a superset of _MATH_, and write _MATH_. 
Sets _MATH_ and _MATH_ are equal, _MATH_, if and only if _MATH_ and _MATH_ are both true. 
We can represent the situation where _MATH_ is a subset of _MATH_ but _MATH_ is not equal to _MATH_ - there is at least one member of _MATH_ that is not a member of _MATH_ - by writing _MATH_.
Since _MATH_ is normalized, we have _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_, that is, _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
Note that _MATH_, since _MATH_ and by (30) we have at least one of _MATH_ and _MATH_ is different from zero.
(ii) Filter performances relating to the magnitude responses of various FIR filters (but differentiators) are the peak absolute error (PAE) between the resultant magnitude response and the ideal magnitude response both in passband (if exists) and in stopband (if exists). 
For the design of filters using the same window, lowpass filters and any other filters (but differentiators) are not much different in terms of PAE.
- From co-occurrence distribution (Fig. _REF_ (c)) of the same target at 4 times (table._REF_).
The fact that among all subsets of the Euclidean ball of given measure, the ones minimizing the surface area in the interior of the ball are exactly spherical caps perpendicular to the boundary, is due to Burago and Maz'ya _CITE_ (see also Almgren _CITE_ and Bokowski and Sperner _CITE_). 
Cianchi noted in _CITE_ that for the unit ball in _MATH_ symmetrization arguments as in the proof of Lemma _REF_/1 and basic calculus give the formula _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, and _MATHDISP_.
(3) Let _MATH_. 
We get _MATH_. 
We can see that periodic solutions appear (See Fig. 3).
The Domain-Range Co-Location Matrix (DRCLM) _CITE_ is another fractal based feature which measures levels of self similarity in different parts of the image. 
It encapsulates information from the relative location of the domain block and it corresponding range block. 
In this method the image is divided into four equal sized non-overlapping segments. 
When a mapping occurs from one segment to the other, then the entry at corresponding cell in the matrix will be incremented. 
This is then repeated for all range blocks in the image.
In all cases, center-to-limb effects in the different standard proxies, combined with the location-dependent sensitivity of the seismic inferences, can contribute to lower the correlation. 
In fact, there may be an anticorrelation component with the emission based proxies, since those incorporate a higher contribution of magnetic activity towards the limb, while the helioseismology inferences present stronger signatures close to disk center. 
New sets of artifical helioseismology data are currently available which can be analyzed from different vantage points and will help to understand (and possibly correct for) the sensitivity function on the seismic maps.

Parameters depend on nature of data. 
They are identified experimentally. 
The parameters considered are minimum supportfor frequent item generation (_MATH_), minimum frequency for pruning of subsequences (_MATH_) and maximum dissimilarity limit (_MATH_) for assigning nearest neighbors. 
For example, the value of _MATH_ is identified as 3. 
The experiments are conducted on a large random sample from training data.
Let _MATH_.

Our main result provides a characterization of the robustness properties of the SDP-based algorithm. 
Hereand below "with high probability (w.h.p.)" means with probability converging to 1 as _MATH_ for _MATH_ fixed. 
Let _MATH_ be _MATH_ nodes distributed uniformly at random in the hypercube _MATH_. 
Further, assume connectivity radius _MATH_, with _MATH_. 
Then w.h.p., the error distance between the estimate _MATH_ returned by the SDP-based algorithm and the correct coordinate matrix _MATH_ is upper bounded as _MATHDISP_. 
Conversely, w.h.p., there exist adversarial measurement errors _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_, Here, _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote universal constants that depend only on _MATH_.
The system _REF_ can be written in the form _REF_, where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
One can easily check that _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
The assumption (A5) holds as well. 
The zero equilibrium point is not asymptotically stable. 
Figure _REF_ presents trajectories of the open loop system _REF_ for the following initial conditions: _MATH_ [m] and _MATH_ [m/s].
As explained in _CITE_ such extensions may be done within the general framework developed there, so apply here also. 
The methodology extends directly, although solving the allocation subproblems becomes more complicated, with a corresponding much larger set of extreme points.
Let _MATH_ be a three-player weighted game, where the players are a group of investors. 
The capitals to invest are _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Suppose that the yield offered by the bank is given by _MATHDISP_. 
Let us assume that players 2 and 3 cannot cooperate without player 1. 
Thus, the set of permissible coalitions is _MATH_. 
Therefore, the game is, _MATHDISP_.
By the Remark _REF_(b) and reordering the states if necessary, for each _MATH_, we can write _MATH_ in the canonical form (depending on _MATH_) _MATHDISP_, in which _MATH_ corresponds to the transitions among recurrent states in _MATH_, for _MATH_ (depending on _MATH_); and _MATH_, for each _MATH_, corresponds to the transitions from the transient states in _MATH_ to the recurrent states in _MATH_. 
Finally, _MATH_ corresponds to the transitions among the transient states in _MATH_.
In such a situation, in particular during the impulsive phase, it is sometimes difficult to disentangle flare motions from CME motions, i.e., to distinguish between "flare expansion" and "CME". 
However, it is clear that both the CME expansion towards the high corona and the nonthermal/thermal energy release beneath the CME are present, representing two physically different aspects of the eruption. 
From the physical point of view, both phenomena could be potential sources of coronal waves. 
The root of the "flare vs. CME" controversy lies in the MHD equation of motion, containing two different terms: the Lorentz force (driver of the CME) and the pressure gradient (presumably driving the expansion of hot flare plasma). 
For example, in CMEs the expansion is driven by the Lorentz force up to large heights, whereas the presumed flare expansion should be driven only temporarily by a pressure pulse. 
In both cases the wave is formed by magnetoplasma motion perpendicular to the magnetic field that could be considered as 3-dimensional piston.
To illustrate how the query processing works from beginning to end, consider Figure _REF_ which shows the query plan for Query (1). 
In the figure, we denote a virtual sensor that is able to observe a specific (_MATH_,_MATH_) pair by a triangle annotated with _MATH_. 
A localization virtual sensor is instantiated based on an available SATLite implementation. 
Notice how at the bottom of the tree, the data coming from the PEOPLE table and the virtual sensors is joined with the new _MATH_ operator to create a stream containing a version of the table with all the observable attributes populated. 
In this example, the PEOPLE table has 1 observable attribute (Location) and 2 rows (one for Peter and one for Mary).
A Gauss-Dirichlet cluster process consists of an infinite sequence of points in _MATH_, together with a random partition of integers into _MATH_ blocks. 
A sequence of length _MATH_ can be sampled as follows, cf. _CITE_: fix the number of mixture modes _MATH_, generate mixing proportions _MATH_ from an exchangeable Dirichlet distribution Dir_MATH_, generate a label sequence _MATH_ from a multinomial distribution, and forget the labels introducing the random partition _MATH_ of _MATH_ induced by _MATH_. 
Integrating out _MATH_, one arrives at a Dirichlet-Multinomial-type prior over partitions: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ denotes the number of blocks present in the partition _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the size of block _MATH_. 
The limit as _MATH_ is well defined and known as the Ewens process (a.k.a. 
Chinese Restaurant process), see for instance _CITE_. 
Given such a partition _MATH_, _MATH_-dimensional observations _MATH_ are generated from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the usual within-class covariance matrix and _MATH_ the between-class matrix, respectively. 
Since the partition process is invariant under permutations, we can always think of _MATH_ being block-diagonal. 
For spherical covariance matrices, _MATH_, the columns of _MATH_ contain independent copies distributed according to a normal distribution with covariance matrix _MATH_. 
Further, the distribution also factorizes over the blocks _MATH_. 
Introducing for each block a _MATH_-matrix of ones _MATH_, the joint distribution of data and partitions reads _MATHDISP_, where the symbol _MATH_ defines an index-vector for all objects assigned to block _MATH_.
(iii) Assume that _MATH_ is bounded, i.e., that _MATH_ is bounded. 
Then, according to Proposition 20 in Amaya et al 2008, _MATH_ is usc at _MATH_ because _MATH_ is closed and convex._MATH_Thus _MATH_ is usc and locally bounded at _MATH_. 
Parameter values for the numerical simulations are given in Table 1. 
The bacteria and phage associated parameters are the same as for the chemostat except for the diffusivities. 
A diffusion coefficient for phage in the range of _MATH_ is taken from Dubin et al. _CITE_. 
Using this data, we can estimate the residence time of bacteria and virus in the flow reactor. 
We estimate _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
This leads to _MATHDISP_. 
_MATHDISP_. 
The two order of magnitude difference in residence times reflect the two order of magnitude difference in diffusivities.
For time independent interactions and external potential, the Lagrangian is time translation invariant. 
This implies energy conservation. 
Here, we consider the invariance under general translations in continuous space and time that vanish at the boundary, _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a time- and space-dependent infinitesimal _MATH_-vector. 
To leading order in _MATH_, the Green function transforms under these translations as _MATH_, where _MATH_. 
One can show that under these transformations the variation of the 2PI effective action _MATH_ can be written as _MATH_, with _MATHDISP_. 
Since, by virtue of the stationarity condition (_REF_), the variation _MATH_ vanishes for all solutions of the equation of motion for _MATH_, an integration by parts shows that _MATH_ is the conserved Noether current for the time-space-translations: _MATHDISP_. 
_MATH_ is identified as the energy-momentum tensor, and the conservation law for total energy is expressed as _MATH_ or _MATH_.
As long as the web keeps expanding, more and new regulation is expected to come up, and more existing standards are available for re-use. 
Mashup users and developers need standards, but they should ask which ones they need for their own purposes.
Figure _REF_ shows that the prediction of the constructed surrogate models leads to have _MATH_ within low error bounds with the maximum % of error being smaller than 4.8%. 
The deviation can be further reduced by increasing the accuracy of the predictions by increasing the number of training sample points.
Figure _REF_ illustrates its operation. 
_MATH_ is a typical oscillating noisy signal with decaying envelope. 
The noise thresholds are shown by the black dashed line and _MATH_ is shown by red dashed line in the in the figure.
The change of spatial morphology of optically thin emission from footpoint to looptop source over the course of some events has been modeled by Melnikov (2006): he solved the Fokker-Planck equation and showed that it is possible to obtain a footpoint-to-looptop transition if the injection occurs close to one of the footpoints, no matter whether the pitch-angle distribution of the injected electrons is isotropic or anisotropic. 
His finding implies that the anisotropy can be built up due to transport effects even if the injection of fast electrons occurs isotropically (although this does not deny the possibility of anisotropic injection).
Let us now turn to the flavor structure of the model. 
We are interested in the Yukawa couplings _MATHDISP_. 
At tree-level all Yukawa couplings vanish with the exception of the top coupling, which is predicted to (roughly) coincide with the gauge coupling at the high scale. 
All other Yukawas appear at higher order, i.e. are proportional to different powers of _MATH_ fields. 
Truncating at six singlets, one obtains _MATHDISP_. 
As discussed, one should not take these textures literally. 
The _MATH_ entries represent polynomials of a total of 46 different fields, which will have hierarchies between their VEVs. 
Nevertheless it is remarkable that the Yukawas exhibit the qualitatively right features: "2B _MATH_all other Yukawa couplings;

Abstract: 
In this paper, a class of neural network models with three neurons is considered. 
By applying the frequency domain approach and analyzing the associated characteristic equation, the existence of bifurcation parameter point is determined. 
If the coefficient _MATH_ is chosen as a bifurcation parameter, it is found that Hopf bifurcation occurs when the parameter _MATH_ passes through a critical value. 
The direction and the stability of Hopf bifurcation periodic solutions are determined by the Nyquist criterion and the graphical Hopf bifurcation theorem. 
Some numerical simulations for justifying the theoretical analysis are also provided.
In the case when we take _MATH_, however, it is impossible to derive directly the boundedness of _MATH_ functional calculus. 
We have to follow an indirect way of proof (see Remark _REF_).
With the adoption of cloud computing, new-fangled business models are coming forth, which consider the amount of data exchanged between the cloud server and its users. 
The decryption keys streaming between entities can greatly affect the invoice which owner will receive from cloud provider. 
In this context, for communication overhead we measure the size of encrypted data flowing between the entities except from the encrypted file; as SAPDS does not impose any restriction on symmetric encryption algorithm.
Set the initial values _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_ which satisfy the identification condition.
As mentioned, Lemma _REF_ allows us to consider _MATH_ under the assumption that all lineages are of type _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
With this in mind, we introduce the following definitions. _MATHDISP_. 
_MATH_ is the time of the _MATH_ mutation event on _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the specific infected cell, a _MATH_ variant, that produces the cell _MATH_, a _MATH_ variant. 
We use _MATH_ as a mnemonic for "ancestor" since _MATH_ will be the ancestor of _MATH_.
Simulation-based obfuscation This secrecy requirement is based on computational indistinguishability. 
Under this formulation one does not restrict the nature of what an adversary must compute. 
Concretely, we require that it is possible to produce, from oracle access to _MATH_, "fake obfuscations." 
These fake obfuscations should be computationally indistinguishable from the real obfuscations _MATH_. 
Hence also every (efficient) function computed on _MATH_ can be approximated using oracle access to _MATH_. 
Obfuscators satisfying _REF_ can easily be seen to satisfy _REF_ as well.
In this paper we propose a new method for design of notch filter where realized filter has approximately linear phase characteristic in the pass-band. 
If we use delay line in the first branch then we realize a phase jump of _MATH_ rad in the second branch in order to get prescribed characteristics. 
In this case resulting filter will have equiripple phase error and equiripple amplitude characteristic in the pass-bands.
The values of _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are bounded by known constant lower and upper bounds _MATH_ as follows: _MATHDISP_ 
The partial derivatives _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are within a known range. 
This is reasonable as general values can be determined in the material selection and operation engineering phase.
Since _MATH_ occurs in _MATH_ but does not occur in _MATH_, by Definition _REF_, _MATHDISP_. 
Now, let _MATH_ be any function subpatch of _MATH_ at layer _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_, where the last inequality follows since _MATH_ might or might not occur in _MATH_.
If no a priory information on some or others parameter values and the distance on a compact _MATH_ _MATH_ is defined by the natural way as _MATH_, then the Maximum Condition (_REF_) can be formulated (and proved) as follows: _MATHDISP_ that represents, evidently, a partial case of the general condition (_REF_) with an uniform absolutely continuous measure, that is, when _MATHDISP_ with _MATH_.
Proof of Theorem 4 We obtain from the assumption _MATH_ that for some _MATH_ small, there exists _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_.
The TDLDA formalism is easy to implement in real space within the higher-order finite difference pseudopotential method _CITE_. 
The real-space pseudopotential code represents a natural choice for implementing TDLDA due to the real-space formulation of the general theory. 
With other methods, such as the plane wave approach, TDLDA calculations typically require an intermediate real-space basis. 
After the original plane wave calculation has been completed, all functions are transferred into that basis, and the TDLDA response is computed in real space _CITE_. 
The additional basis complicates calculations and introduces an extra error. 
The real-space approach simplifies implementation and allows us to perform the complete TDLDA response calculation in a single step.
However, a very different technique, based on a generalization of ray theory _CITE_ presents several novel insights which greatly enhance interpretation and understanding. 
To date, this has been applied only in two dimensions (2D), in the sense that gravity, the magnetic field, and the direction of wave propagation all lie in the same plane, and we shall maintain that restriction here. 
This decouples the Alfven wave from the problem, leaving only the fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves (although see _CITE_ for a quantitative estimation of 3D coupling).
We first show Lemma _REF_. 
Lemma _REF_ follows then after minor modifications of the proof. 
Let _MATH_ be a sequence converging to zero and _MATH_. 
For sufficiently small _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_. 
Now notice that _MATH_ is a Levy subordinator with drift 0 and Levy measure _MATH_ as given by Lemma _REF_. 
Hence it follows from _CITE_ that _MATHDISP_. 
Together with _REF_, this implies _MATH_, because _MATH_ was arbitrary. 
As _MATH_, _MATH_ thus converges to zero in probability, and hence a.s. along a further subsequence _MATH_. 
This shows that on a set of probability one, the sequence _MATH_ has the cluster point 0, and moreover that 0 is the unique cluster point. 
Therefore _MATH_ a.s. and by the right-continuity of _MATH_ the claim follows.
The effect of the known traffic information on an agent's migrating decision making is expressed by the function _MATH_ which is defined as the traffic cost of an agent moving from _MATH_ to _MATH_ where _MATH_. 
Thus, the maximum traffic cost function, _MATH_, of an agent moving out from _MATH_ can be defined as _MATHDISP_. 
which is also decided by collected traffic information. 
Therefore, the traffic cost balance on each link can be mathematically modeled by minimizing the maximum cost to neighboring peers which is a min-max problem as follows: _MATHDISP_. 
Without lose of generality, we assume that functions _MATH_ are differentiable. 
Obviously, the maximum value function _MATH_ is an non-differentiable function.
The spatial dependence of the propagator in coordinate-space representation of a scalar excitation in the free theory and in a theory with a scalar glueball bound-state are confronted in Fig._REF_. 
We note that, for small Euclidean times, the free theory correlator is more peaked than in the case of bound-state correlator. 
On the other hand, at large Euclidean times, the situation is reversed: the free correlator is more spread-out than the single-particle correlator. 
In other words, as expected, free gluons de-localize more rapidly than a system of interacting gluons, bound in a glueball.
To summarize again, with requirements R2 and R4 relaxed to at least three zero feedback bits and exploiting the symmetry ones-case, we obtain _MATHDISP_ with _MATHDISP_ using precomputational storage of size _MATH_.
Paxson and Floyd _CITE_ have found that for most of the traffic in the world wide web session and connection arrivals are modeled well using Poisson processes, but packet interarrivals are better described with heavy tailed distributions. 
This is further confirmed by Crovella et al. _CITE_. 
In particular, the hyper-exponential distribution has proved to be useful to approximate heavy-tailed distributions. 
Xu et al. _CITE_ use such approximations to formulate generalized Petri nets in order to study the properties of distributed manufacturing systems. 
The hyper-exponential is one of the motivating factors of our two class Markov decision process formulation.
Given an input image _MATH_, the resizing operation rescales the _MATH_-axis and _MATH_-axis and thus changes the image aspect ratio. 
The rescale factors of the image in the _MATH_- and _MATH_-directions are denoted by _MATH_ and _MATH_, respectively. 
We generate a triangular mesh _MATH_ over _MATH_. 
Our goal is to compute a new triangular mesh _MATH_, which has the same topology with _MATH_, for the resized image _MATH_. 
This can be formulated as a problem of warping the original mesh _MATH_ to the target mesh _MATH_. 
Intuitively, the important triangles should be preserved by their aspect ratios in both _MATH_- and _MATH_-directions. 
The less important triangles can be stretched to a greater extent.
Now, let _MATH_ for _MATH_ be a set of simple roots for the Lie algebra _MATH_ of type _MATH_. 
The root _MATH_ determines a unique minuscule representation _MATH_ whose highest weight is dual to _MATH_ (here _MATH_ is the natural representation of _MATH_). 
The weights of this representation are in bijection with the sets in _MATH_ and the highest weight vector is _MATH_ with weight _MATH_. 
Identifying simple roots _MATH_ and _MATH_ we obtain the bijection between weights and _MATH_-divisors specified by the columns of the following table _MATHDISP_
Now let us consider the operator _MATH_. 
It is well-known that (see formulas (47a), (47b)) in page 65 of [19]) the eigenvalues of the operators _MATH_ consist of the sequences _MATH_ satisfying _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_. 
The eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and associated functions of _MATH_ are _MATHDISP_ for _MATH_respectively. 
The biorthogonal systems analogous to (16), (17) are _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_ respectively.
In addition, since the leader-follower problem is also considered here, we denote the discrepancy between the orientation of the leader rigid body and the constant desired attitude _MATH_ (which is available to only the leader) by the unit-quaternion _MATH_, defined in _REF_ and satisfying the dynamics _REF_, i.e., _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is defined similar to _REF_, and the subscript "_MATH_" is used to designate the leader.
Case 3: _MATH_. 
For _MATH_ we can have two cases. 
First, if _MATH_, then _MATH_ is _MATHDISP_.
The laser is locked on the filter cavity using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique _CITE_. 
The phase modulated laser light is coupled to the filter cavity. 
In the reflected light, the modulation signal is detected by a detector (D2) and is demodulated with a mixer to generate an error signal that is amplified and fed back to the filter cavity. 
When the cavity is locked, we measured more than 70 mW transmitted light power for an incident power of 120 mW, representing a transmission efficiency of almost 60%. 
The phase noise was suppressed by the resonant optical feedback. 
The optical locking only occurs when the optical feedback phase and the laser frequency are simmultaneouly in the vicinity of the optimum values. 
In other words, the optical feedback phase must be locked on the laser frequency phase, because it easily changes due to thermal fluctuations. 
For this purpose PZT-p was dithered by a 30 kHz sinusoidal signal and the light leaking from the filter cavity was monitored by a photodiode (D1). 
The error signal was derived by demodulation of the dithering signal and then fed back to the PZT-p via a piezo driver. 
This was successful keep the optical lock for several hours.
Sometimes instead of _MATH_ we will write _MATH_ for the solution of (2.1) with the initial function (2.2). 
Existence and uniqueness theorems for the problem (2.1), (2.2) are considered in [85-88, 133, 134].
Consider now an orthonormal frame _MATH_ such that the _MATH_-axis is the common perpendicular to _MATH_ and _MATH_, the origin of the frame is the point of the _MATH_-axis equidistant to _MATH_ and _MATH_, and the _MATH_ and _MATH_-axes are the bisectors of the projections of _MATH_ and _MATH_ onto the plane orthogonal to the _MATH_-axis. 
Note that this coordinate system is, up to a possible change of orientation of the axes and a possible exchange of the _MATH_ and _MATH_-axes, the one we considered in Sections _REF_ and _REF_ and which has been used to draw Fig. _REF_. 
When the parameter _MATH_ of the homotopy varies from 0 to 1, the lines vary continuously, and thus the frame _MATH_ can be defined to vary continuously in terms of _MATH_.
Suppose _MATH_ is a closed _MATH_ curve, and _MATH_, _MATH_ satisfy (_REF_) and (_REF_), with constants _MATH_. 
Then there exist positive constants _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, _MATH_, depending on _MATH_, _MATH_, and the constants _MATH_ such that for arbitrary _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_, the normal line _MATH_ intersects the arc _MATH_ at a unique point _MATHDISP_, where the detail coefficient _MATH_ satisfies _MATHDISP_. 
Moreover, the new set _MATH_ of arc-length parameters is strictly increasing, and satisfies _MATHDISP_, as well as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_.
There have been many approaches to study solutions of differential equations on time scales, such as method of lower and upper solutions, fixed-point theory, coincidence degree theory and so on (see _CITE_). 
In _CITE_, authors used the fixed point theorem of strict-set-contraction to study the existence of positive periodic solutions for functional differential equations with impulse effects on time scales. 
However, the study of the existence and multiplicity of solutions for differential equations on time scales using variational method has received considerably less attention (see, for example _CITE_). 
Variational method is, to best of our knowledge, novel and it may open a new approach to deal with nonlinear problems with some type of discontinuities such as impulses.
Let all the conditions be identical to those in Theorem _REF_ except that the modifier locus controls a single, global mutation rate _MATH_, scaling all the _MATH_ parameters equally: _MATHDISP_. 
Then the spectral radius of _MATH_ is non-increasing in _MATH_ for _MATH_, and strictly decreasing if _MATH_ for every _MATH_.
In order to study the characteristics of duplicates we collect data from YouTube, aiming at obtaining different groups of identical videos. 
The strategy used to collect duplicates is based on searching random words on YouTube, and collecting videos which appear as search results. 
When YouTube shows the search results, it currently filters the duplicates out, showing only one video per group of duplicates. 
However, YouTube used to offer links to these groups. 
Our crawler followed these links, collecting information of duplicates and their owners. 
From this point on, we refer to the sets of duplicates grouped by YouTube on the search results as group of duplicates.
The Interval Model is simulated using an implementation of the discrete time random walk described above, with walkers making transitions between sites which represent the subinterval midpoints. 
At each fractional time step, _MATH_, a random number is generated to choose a walker and then a second random number is generated to choose its transition, using the transition probabilities obtained above. 
This algorithm is not as efficient as the continuous time random walk algorithm described by Gillespie _CITE_, particularly when transition rates involve a wide range of time scales. 
However, discrete time random walks provide a simple setting for deriving the Interval Model and use of a discrete time simulation algorithm is consistent.
The proposals in _CITE_, _CITE_ and _CITE_ are based on the use of the so-called smoothing splines (SS-ANOVA). 
Initially, the SS-ANOVA had the strong limitation that the time was considered as an additional factor, which implies that the values _MATH_ and _MATH_ are independent if _MATH_. 
This requirement is somewhat unreasonable because this independence would imply that the functions _MATH_ are discontinuous in every point, while, in practice, continuity of the observed functions seems to be customary (this limitation remains in the available version of the _REF_gss R-package _CITE_, which is a practical implementation of the SS-ANOVA).
Next we turn to the security of _MATH_. 
We show that _MATH_ securely computes the functionality _MATH_ in the presence of static semi-honest adversaries relative to a _MATH_. 
We use the ideal-process simulator _MATH_ of _MATH_ for the adaptive setting to construct two probabilistic polynomial-time simulators _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_ in the static setting, such that _MATHDISP_ _MATHDISP_
To speed computations up we can assume every reader keeps an array with predefined computations of _MATH_, and _MATH_, being _MATH_, and _MATH_ the maximum value that _MATH_ can take. 
Then, the computation of equation (_REF_) requires at most _MATH_ sums. 
Since _MATH_ is obtained after computing (_REF_) at most (_MATH_) times, the total number of operations required for computing _MATH_ at the end of every round will be, at most _MATH_ sums. 
As can be seen, the algorithm has a linear complexity because requires _MATH_ operations.
Proof. 
We may set _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, by Theorem 3.1, then as _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
By Proposition _REF_, _MATH_ is continuous on _MATH_, hence _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore _MATHDISP_. 
Since _MATH_ and _MATH_ are continuous in _MATH_ and _MATH_, for sufficiently small _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_, when deducing the second _MATH_, we have used the fact that _MATHDISP_. 
Consequently, for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
An application of Lemma _REF_ gives the desired result for _MATH_. 
It's important to note that the aforementioned response regimes can also coexist as can be seen in fig. _REF_ where we can see a quasi-periodic response and what seems to be a chaotic one for the same parameters, differing only in initial condition. this is most interesting since even though the stroboscopic maps reveals essentially different response regimes, the time series shows that these are two close attractors that coexist there.
MP4 or MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding) is a container format. 
It can contain all kinds of multimedia content-like audio, video, 2D and 3D graphics and animated avatars, besides user interactivity features. 
MPEG-4 stores audio, scenes (described by the scene language BIFS), and other multi-media content using the ISO Base Media File Format, while AVC means the storage of AVC (ISO/IEC 14496-10/AVC) standard 4 data (which may be audio, video, or sub-scenes) within the files of the ISO Base Media File Format. 
MP4 containers are box-structured files. 
A box-structured file consists of a series of boxes that have a size and a type. 
The file structure is object-oriented. 
All box-structured files start with a file-type box (possibly after a box-structured signature) that defines the best use of the file, and the specifications to which the file complies.
Various paradigmatic examples of the alterations (due to substructural changes) of the driving force with respect to the "values" it would assume if the material would be simple can be quoted as mentioned in the first section of this paper. 
Another case is analyzed below: quasi-static crack propagation in quasicrystals.
When a Hopf bifurcation occur through the fractional-order _MATH_ (at _MATH_) then the diameter _MATH_ of the resulting limit cycle is close to zero in the neighborhood of _MATH_ and increase as _MATH_ increasing like _MATH_, for example the diameter of the resulting limit cycle from the bifurcation value _MATH_ mentioned above, is calculated approximately using the Poincar√© section, the results are close to _MATH_, so we have _MATH_, _MATH_ which is similar to the integer-order case when replacing q by a bifurcation parameter. 
Figure (_REF_) shows a comparative representation between _MATH_, and the calculated _MATH_.
A real-time SD cluster can accept real-time transactions. 
A real-time transaction has a time constraint of completing its execution before a deadline. 
Transactions with early deadlines have high priority. 
They can preempt the execution of transactions with late deadlines. 
Our previous works show that the SD cluster is effective to process real-time transactions by exploiting inter-node parallelism and reducing the amount of disk I/O with judicious data caching _CITE_.
Let _MATH_ be the sequence of orthogonal polynomials associated with the _MATH_-Sobolev inner product _REF_ with _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be defined by the recurrence relation _MATHDISP_. 
Then, for _MATH_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ the second order difference equation _REF_ is reduced to _REF_ and, therefore we have _MATHDISP_. 
Thus, the theorem follows from Proposition _REF_ and Lemma _REF_.
Interchanging the gyrotriangle vertices _MATH_ and _MATH_, _REF_ gives _MATHDISP_
We will write _MATH_ for the set of hook permutations, its elements of content _MATH_ forming _MATH_ (where _MATH_ is any composition). 
Hook permutations can be graphically represented by the list _MATH_ where the cells of hook _MATH_ are labeled by _MATH_, or by square arrays of size _MATH_ such that entry _MATH_ is empty unless _MATH_ in which case it is occupied by the _MATH_th hook _MATH_. 
Illustrations are given on Figure _REF_.
The paper is organized by following sections. 
The method section gives a brief information about the serial code which will be parallelized with MPI in Sect. 3. 
Section 4 gives pseudo code and the method's computational complexity according to the modifications in Sect. 3. 
Section 5 gives the performance of the parallel algorithm with speed-up analysis. 
The last section consists of conclusion and limitation of the method.
Finally, we will show that the second term on the right hand side of _REF_ satisfies the desired estimates. 
Consider the truncated operator _MATHDISP_ Note that _MATH_ for every _MATH_. 
We will see that there is a non-increasing function _MATH_, such that _MATH_ is integrable in _MATH_, and _MATHDISP_.
Fourth order condition _MATH_) There exists a positive real parameter _MATH_, negative real parameters _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_, functions _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ for _MATH_, all of constant sign for large values of _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_.
The interaction of a fast stream and the upstream slow solar wind compresses the plasma and magnetic field at the boundary, causing a density and magnetic field enhancement in the upstream slow wind. 
On the other hand, in the fast solar wind region, the kinetic energy is transformed to thermal energy, causing plasma heating and expansion (e.g., Alves, Echer, and Gonzalez, _CITE_ and references therein). 
If the CH-HSS structure is stable over a longer period of time, the pattern of the interaction region is repeated each solar rotation, which is called a corotating interaction region (CIR).
Antenna radiation characteristics (i.e., angular and polarisation patterns and efficiencies) at the Rx and Tx ends interact with the propagation channel to determine the overall communication channel performance. 
Due to the terminal mobility, the propagation channels in realistic communication scenarios are rarely static. 
To assure sufficiently strong and orthogonal sub-channels, the changes in the spatial propagation scenarios need to be tracked and preferably adapted to some extent. 
In _CITE_ two new figures of merits are proposed to gain sufficient insight into the dynamics of the communication channel eigenmodes: eigen coherence time and eigen coherence bandwidth. 
Eigen coherence time is defined as the delay time in which the auto covariance of the eigenvectors in the communication channel goes below the value of _MATH_. 
The coherence bandwidth is the corresponding measure in the frequency domain. 
Through practical evaluations of _MATH_ MIMO systems under urban propagation channel conditions, the eigen-mode dynamics for three antenna configurations at the mobile Rx end of a communication system are evaluated at 2 GHz (see Fig. _REF_). 
Two of the Rx terminals (a laptop and a PDA) are examples of realistic user equipment with antenna designs appropriate for the available space. 
The third Rx terminal, which also serves as a reference, comprises four _MATH_ oriented dipoles in two orthogonal planes. 
The results from the measurements reveal that walking conditions give shorter coherence times and higher dynamics in the eigenmodes, in comparison to the stationary conditions (see Fig. _REF_). 
In particular, the reference antennas stand out with the shortest coherence time. 
The high dynamics in the communication channel are enabled through unobstructed omnidirectional behaviour of the dipole antennas, when compared to the laptop and PDA. 
The later suffer from less polarisation and angular diversity due to the terminal design and user impact during the measurements. 
Thus, the antenna system with more omnidirectional patterns experience more channel variations and consequently gives a shorter coherence time. 
Hence, by "limiting" the beamwidth or directionality of the antennas, longer coherence times can be achieved, which is beneficial from the channel feedback point of view. 
However, as highlighted in _CITE_, the channel feedback or eigenstate tracking is only improved at the expense of limiting the scattering and increasing the branch power ratio at the receiving ports. 
Thus, limiting the channel variations can only be advantageous where the scattering richness of the channel, as well as the efficiencies and correlation properties of the antennas, can together assure orthogonality in the communication channel eigenmodes. 
The study in _CITE_ is based on an indoor _MATH_ MIMO system measurements at _MATH_ GHz with omnidirectional dipoles and directional feed horn antennas used at the Rx side.
The changing requirements of transportation and logistic companies and the growing complexity of planning strategies have recently induced the appearance of new vehicle routing problems, many of which include complex constraints as precedence or loading constraints and merge matters that used to belong to separated fields. 
One of these problems that have appeared during the last few years is the Double Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks (DTSPMS), that is introduced in Petersen and Madsen _CITE_ as one of the main problems of a joint project with a computer software company. 
The classical vehicle routing problems have been very much studied during the last decades, but the DTSPMS introduces into these kind of problems some new elements that have not been treated jointly in detail in the literature yet. 
We are dealing with a routing problem in which some pickups and deliveries must be performed in two independent networks, verifying some precedence and loading constraints imposed on the vehicle.
Typically, the radio regulations and standards are defining how the communication system accesses the transmission media. 
However, all the regulations are not globally accepted or prevailing. 
For example, the FCC in the USA liberated a frequency band from _MATH_ GHz to _MATH_ GHz for unlicensed UWB transmission but in Europe, the corresponding frequency range is only from 6 GHz to _MATH_ GHz. 
The maximum power spectral density for transmission is limited to _MATH_ dBm/MHz in both regions.
The claims that have caught attention are from _CITE_, who analysed WMAP3 data and found _MATHDISP_ 
This would exclude the hypothesis of Gaussian fluctuations at 99.5% confidence. 
If real, this would be extremely significant, and favour non-standard forms of inflation, such as DBI (Dirac-Born-Infield, _CITE_) for which one expects _MATH_, or ekpyrotic scenarios (_CITE_).
A solution of the problem (2.1), (2.2) is a process _MATH_ such that _MATH_ for _MATH_ and with probability 1 _MATHDISP_. 
The last integral is understood in the Ito sense.
The following description of the stepwise procedure corresponds to Algorithms _MATH_ and _MATH_ in Romano and Wolf (2005). 
Let _MATH_ be the strategy with the _MATH_th smallest _MATH_-value, i.e. _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATH_ denote the number of rejections in the first _MATH_ steps (with _MATH_). 
Further, consider the empirical bootstrap distribution of the maximum of the _MATH_ smallest _MATH_-values, _MATHDISP_. 
In the first step, our test statistics are simply _MATH_ and we reject _MATH_ on a significance level of _MATH_ if _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, then the procedure stops. 
Otherwise, we move on to the next step. 
In step _MATH_, we consider the _MATH_ smallest _MATH_-statistics _MATHDISP_. 
We reject the null hypothesis _MATH_ in step _MATH_ if _MATHDISP_. 
We want to add a few remarks on the robust estimation of the standard errors _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The simplest case occurs when the underlying portfolio returns of the strategies are assumed to be multivariate normally distributed and serially independent. 
Jobson and Korkie (1981) derived an analytical expression for the standard error of the estimated difference of two Sharpe ratios under this assumption. 
Their formula has frequently been used in the literature, see, e.g., the test procedure of DeMiguel et al (2009b). 
Lo (2002) as well as Ledoit and Wolf (2008) point out that the Jobson-Korkie-test is inappropriate in the case of serially correlated returns or a heavy-tailed return distribution. 
According to the stylized facts of financial time series, asset returns are heavy-tailed and squared returns are serially correlated (see, e.g., McNeil et al 2005, pp. 117ff). 
Any testing procedure which is based on the normal distribution hypothesis and the assumption of serial independence might lead to wrong conclusions.
Figure _REF_ shows that the user can easily configure the control of a simulation in selected regions and times. 
The control is set up to start in the middle of the simulation and is effective only in the projected volume from a selected region in screen space. 
The user can also modify settings on a time line to determine the interval and curve at which the control weights _MATH_ ramp up as the simulation approaches the first fully controlled frame. 
The result, as set up, is uncontrolled for the first part of the simulation, and then starts to shift towards the preview, and after a short transition, becomes completely matched to the preview.
We estimated the dependence of complexity indicators on spatial sampling by decreasing the pixel scale of the HMI data to the one of MDI magnetograms with a linear resampling of the data. 
Figure _REF_ shows the trends of the fractal parameters _MATH_, D_MATH_ and multifractal indicators _MATH_, _MATH_ obtained for the AR from the analysis of the time series of the original MDI and HMI sub-arrays with 96 min cadence and of the HMI re-sampled set. 
We found that all the analyzed parameters are significantly susceptible to the spatial sampling (30-40% change), although in different ways, especially when their evolution is considered with respect to the AR activity. 
The various trends are fairly consistent, but some distinct differences among them are also found. 
In particular, we found that the trends of the parameters derived from the HMI data re-sampled to MDI observations differ from the ones obtained from the latter. 
Likely, this difference is due to the different flux sensitivity of the instruments and to the non-uniform noise over the disk on MDI observations. 
Similarly to fractal parameters estimates, the variation of multifractal values derived from the HMI data re-sampled to MDI observations differ from the one obtained from the latter data set, the difference between estimated parameters exceeds measurement uncertainties for most of the values.
Exemplar Recognition based on Exemplar approaches, aim at directly extracting the sequences of feature vector from input video, and then compare it with template sequences using algorithm (e.g., dynamic time warping).
The verification framework is sufficiently flexible and expressive to support module inclusion and extension. 
The use of the editor tool makes it easier and faster to create PTPN models. 
Despite the representation of PTPN elements provided by the editor, the palette is equipped with PTPN components in order to facilitate the illustration of complex tasks and computing resources. 
So, it is sufficient for the developper to select the structured PTPN class from the palette with the communication means.
To define a condition number for the Moore-Penrose inverse which could be of some use one faces the following difficulty (see in Campbell-Meyer _CITE_, page 247). 
Unpleasant fact. 
Suppose _MATH_ is of neither full column nor full row rank. 
Then, for any number _MATH_ and any _MATH_ there exists a matrix _MATH_, _MATH_, such that _MATH_. 
Therefore, definition (_REF_) would make ill-posed matrices that have a perfectly well-defined Moore-Penrose inverse. 
A way out is to restrict definition (_REF_) to structured perturbations, i.e., perturbations which do not alter the rank of _MATH_.
Proof. 
The induced homomorphism _MATH_ is defined by _MATH_, where _MATH_ is given by _MATH_. 
Now _MATH_. 
Then for _MATH_, _MATH_. 
_MATH_ _MATH_ be a subgroup of index _MATH_ of a group _MATH_ and no non-trivial normal subgroup of _MATH_ is contained in _MATH_. 
Then _MATH_ is isomorphic to a subgroup of _MATH_.
On the other side, the solar physics community prepared in some way for this huge challenge by organizing a series of 4 Solar Image Processing (SIP) workshops over the last 8 years, which stimulated an exponentially increasing industry of new image analysis techniques, automated feature recognition codes, and involvement of artificial intelligence algorithms. 
Literature on solar image processing techniques has grown to over 200 refereed publications at the time of writing, with the majority been produced after the year 2000, which constitutes a faster growth rate than for the overall increase of _MATH_ refereed solar publications per year (Figure 2). 
We can therefore anticipate that efforts invested in the development, sophistication, and automation of new solar data analysis techniques will continue to grow at a fast pace during the next decade. 
New technologies also drive our handling and presentation of solar data. 
3D DLP (chip) HDTV (high-definition television) sets are just becoming available for home entertainment, which can equally be used for display of 3D science data. 
The presentation of 3D reconstructions of solar active regions, filaments, flares, CMEs, and MHD simulations will benefit from such advanced off-the-shelf hardware, which doubtlessly will enter our future workshops and conferences. 
The availability of data analysis and numerical simulation codes will enable observers to interpret data with their own theoretical modeling and vice versa. 
Since many observables do not have a one-to-one correspondence with physical parameters, or are too complex to be modeled with physics-based models, algorithms with machine learning will be applied more widely, which will make trainable feature recognition modules more efficient. - The sky is the limit!
We suppose that there are two detectors (A and B) which are located in space _MATH_ within the two localized regions _MATH_ and _MATH_ respectively, well separated from one another. 
If one makes a local observation in the region _MATH_ then this means that one measures not only the spin observable _MATH_ but also some another observable which describes the localization of the particle like the energy density or the projection operator _MATH_ to the region _MATH_. 
We will consider here correlation functions of the projection operators _MATH_.
Summarizing, the full finite element model of the loading area features _MATH_ nodal variables and _MATH_ constraints. 
We next aim at determining a reduced model with less than _MATH_ elastic degrees of freedom. 
Since the number of constraints is already beyond that threshold, the detailed interface between loading area and load must be weakened. 
Two rigid bodies in the plane can be coupled by 3 constraint equations, and this can be transferred to the elastic-rigid coupling. 
An example is the choice _MATHDISP_, for the discretization of the Lagrange multipliers. 
Here, the straight line of length _MATH_ between the two bodies is parametrized by the real variable _MATH_, and each translational and rotational degree of freedom is associated with one of the 3 multipliers. 
Note that this approach can be viewed as an averaging technique, compare (_REF_). 
For vanishing displacements, it reduces to the usual rigid body constraint.
SBLF Positioning Controls: 
The positioning controls _REF_ and _REF_ developed using SBLF are simulated with crane desired position _MATH_, constraints _MATH_, _MATH_, control gains _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, subsea payload desired position _MATH_ and constraints _MATH_, _MATH_. 
The spatial time representation is shown in Fig. _REF_ and the position, control and tension at the top (crane) and bottom (subsea payload) boundaries are shown in Figs. _REF_ and _REF_ respectively. 
The designed control is able to keep the crane at the desired position and the subsea payload position converge from the origin to the desired position when the system is subjected to the environmental disturbances.
In this section, we first review and analyze previous Bayesian resolution enhancement algorithms. 
Segall et al. _CITE_ develop a novel algorithm that solves the registration, interpolation, restoration, and post-processing problems simultaneously. 
In _CITE_, the relationship between the neighboring LR frames and the target HR frame is modeled as: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a sub sampling matrix, _MATH_ is a matrix filtering the high-resolution image (_MATH_/_MATH_ are assumed to be known), _MATH_ is a vector that contains the compressed low-resolution image with dimension _MATH_ ( _MATH_ is the size of the LR image), _MATH_ is the target high-resolution image, _MATH_ is a two-dimensional matrix which describes the displacements across the entire frame with dimension _MATH_ (_MATH_ is the magnification factor), _MATH_ includes the errors introduced during compression, registration, and acquisition. 
During the process, the noise introduced by the quantization in compression is assumed to be dominant. 
So the following formulation can be obtained: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the covariance of the quantization noise in the spatial domain of frame _MATH_. 
The registration errors are not taken into account, and all pixels in frame _MATH_ are assumed to be observable or predictable via motion compensation from the HR image _MATH_. 
But as we know, it is not true. 
The motion estimation is inaccurate, especially when the motion within the video sequence is complex. 
There are always some pixels which cannot be predicted accurately. 
Thus the above formulation leads to super-resolution results with artifacts, especially in moving regions. 
As shown in Fig. _REF_(c), it is noticed that there are new artifacts introduced around the top circles on the mobile ball, though the numbers on the calendar are enhanced.
Chapter _REF_ shows different scenarios of SI and SS that can be realized in SS systems. 
It also discusses corresponding pseudocode algorithms.
In (_REF_), _MATH_ is the viscous damping coefficient, _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the components of the sticktion and slipping forces, _MATH_ is a smooth function of the tangential velocity, _MATH_, which is defined in terms of the central point of the contact region, _MATH_, and the normal vector at the contact, _MATH_, as follows. _MATHDISP_
The first recognition experiment used 14-state context-independent character HMMs and a character tri-gram LM, both trained on the IFN/ENIT corpus. 
For training the character HMMs, we used a CTM configuration with a separate codebook of 256 Gaussians for each character in the training set. 
The recognition accuracy on the city names in the development set was 40.7% with this configuration.
Let us modify the original Gaussian ansatz in order to incorporate the observations of _CITE_ and _CITE_ and choose the _MATH_-dependence of GPDs in the form _MATHDISP_. 
The value of the parameter _MATH_ is fixed by the low _MATH_ experimental data while the free parameters _MATH_ (_MATH_ - for _MATH_ and _MATH_- - for _MATH_) were chosen to reproduce the experimental data in the whole _MATH_ region. 
Indeed, large _MATH_ behavior corresponds to _MATH_ in (10), (11), where the dependence on _MATH_ is weak.
MgB_MATH_ is a new type of superconducting material which was found at the beginning of 2001, with the highest superconducting transition temperature of 39 K _CITE_. 
It has the advantages as follows, high transition temperature, the larger coherence length, higher upper critical field, the simple structure, the low cost and so on. 
In addition, it also has a broad prospect of application in the field including the superconducting power and electronic devices. 
Most of the investigations are focused on physical properties of MgB_MATH_, such as the superconducting gaps _CITE_, thermodynamics and transport properties _CITE_. 
Much theoretical attention is also attracted by the elastic properties of MgB_MATH_ under different pressure due to the contradictory experimental results about the anisotropy, ranging from isotropic to highly anisotropic _CITE_. 
It is well known that the defects (dislocations, Mg vacancies) and lattice strain can also strongly affect the superconductivity and mechanical properties of MgB_MATH_ _CITE_. 
To the knowledge of authors, the dislocation properties in MgB_MATH_ are lack of study in the previous literatures, although it is important to understand the superconducting behavior, such as transition temperature and transition width _CITE_. 
Fortunately, a detailed study on the microstructure and dislocations in MgB_MATH_ has been reported by Zhu et al. _CITE_. 
It is found that both dislocations and stacking faults (SF) are located in basal plane. 
Most of the dislocations in MgB_MATH_ are perfect dislocations with mixed edge and screw components. 
The partial dislocations bonding a stacking fault are also observed by transmission electron microscopy. 
Zhu et al. _CITE_ proposed a structure model for a perfect _MATH_ edge dislocation dissociated into two partial dislocations in the reaction _MATH_, bounding a stacking fault in between. 
This reaction involving the sliding basal plane of atoms over each other is not energy favorable, while the basal plane is simulated by a set of hard spheres, as usually done in FCC structure materials. 
The movement of _MATH_ displacement will not result in a local minimal energy. 
The _MATH_ displacement results in a local maximal energy due to the atoms on the top of atoms in the adjacent basal plane. 
This energy is also calculated by Yan et al. _CITE_ and the value is 932 erg/nm_MATH_, which is extremely high compared with those in other materials, e.g. 318 and 254 erg/cm_MATH_ for the intrinsic and extrinsic stacking faults, respectively, in diamond. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the partial dislocations observed by Zhu et al. _CITE_ may not be dissociated from _MATH_ perfect dislocation due to the high energy. 
Furthermore, the _MATH_ perfect edge dislocation with a constrained structure rather than a dissociated one is probed by Du et al. _CITE_ using the high resolution transmission electron microscopy.
Nota Bene: formula a), in the unsimplified form, can be found in Bierens de Haan tables _CITE_ and in _CITE_. 
Formul√¶ b)-d) seem to be unreleased yet.
The 3-block[12,13] partial Maxdiff method is a generalization of covariance analysis, where only the covariances between blocks (1, 2) and (1, 3) are taken into account; we shall show that the 3-block[12,13] partial Maxdiff problem is equivalent to a weighted 2-block Maxbet problem. 
For the 2-block Maxbet problems the approach taken in this paper is different from, and complements in a way, the iterative approach developed in Hanafi and Ten Berge (2003), Zhang and Chu (2009) or Zhang, Liao and Sun (2011), where the aim is to find good directions or good starting points for the monotonic convergence of the Maxbet algorithm to the global optimal value. 
In particular, for the 2-block Maxbet problem, Hanafi and Ten Berge (2003), based on Theorem 1, provide an algorithm which monotonically converges to the optimal global value. 
The aim of this paper is to use a non-iterative algebraic approach to find the global maximum for the 2-block Maxbet and the 3-block[12,13] partial Maxdiff problems by picking the best solution from the complete solution set for the MEP involved. 
To do this we generalize the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, Equation (4), to a system of two characteristic polynomials, and provide the complete solution set of the latter via Sylvester resultants.
There is yet another notion of reducibility called Turing reducibility which is obtained by generalizing mapping reducibility. 
Turing reducibility is defined in terms of an oracle. 
An oracle is a device that is equipped to a Turing machine. 
When the Turing machine asks an oracle whether any string _MATH_ is a member of a certain language, say _MATH_, the oracle is supposed to answer the question by reporting YES/NO to the Turing machine depending on _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
Such a Turing machine that has the additional capability of querying an oracle about the membership of language _MATH_ is called an oracle Turing machine which is denoted by _MATH_. 
More specifically, an oracle Turing machine queries an oracle by placing a string on a special oracle tape and then obtains a YES/NO answer from the oracle in a single computation step. 
Language _MATH_ is Turing reducible to language _MATH_ if there exists an oracle Turing machine with oracle of _MATH_ that decides _MATH_, which is denoted by _MATH_. 
If we restrict Turing reducibility by imposing the conditions that an oracle Turing machine queries an oracle only once at the end of computation and yields as output the answer from the oracle, then the Turing reducibility turns out to be the mapping reducibility. 
Thus Turing reducibility can be thought of as a generalization of mapping reducibility.
Case 1: _MATH_. 
Then, clearly, _MATH_ and hence, _MATH_. 
So, by (_REF_) ERO does not allocate any cost to _MATH_ for the construction of edges in _MATH_. 
Let's now consider _MATH_.
For the labeling phase, the problem with mixed types of descriptors is that different types may convey different amounts of information. 
In particular, textual attributes are the most informative ones, which entails the risk of predominance of textual labels over the others if a single labeling process is applied. 
To avoid it, labeling over text can be performed independently from numerical and categorical attributes, followed by a final merge step.
Condition 4 means that the ''net''growth rate of AD cells is equal to the ''natural net''growth rate of AI cells and they are positive, under which both AD cells and AI cells contribute to the tumor growth as shown in (4.13) and the tumor relapse could not be avoided. 
In fact, by (4.13) and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_.
Let _MATH_, where _MATH_ is a fiber bundle, in the category of smooth manifolds. 
We say that _MATH_ is functionally stable if for any compact regular solution _MATH_, such that _MATH_ one has quantum solutions _MATH_, _MATH_, such that _MATH_, where _MATH_.
In addition to the principal component analysis (Section _REF_), one of the most wide-spread and generally useful methods of multivariate analysis is the canonical correlation analysis (CCA). 
The CCA method allows us to handle sets of data of the form _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ in general. 
The basic premise is that the correlation between _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the most relevant carrier of information for this data set. 
By CCA we wish to reduce the dimensionality of the data by projecting _MATH_ and _MATH_ to a smaller set of canonical variables, among which we attempt to impose maximum correlation. 
From this viewpoint, the task of CCA is precisely opposite to the task of PCA, where data should become decorrelated.
In Zanlungo et al.'s model, forces are based, not on current positions but on expected future positions. 
Agent _MATH_ computes the earliest time to interaction, _MATH_, to a set of near-by neighbors. 
The time to interaction between agent _MATH_ and _MATH_ is the time _MATH_ at which agents _MATH_ and _MATH_ are at their closest and the agent's overall time to interaction is simply the minimum time to interaction across all neighbors: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the set of agent _MATH_'s neighboring agents. 
In the case where agents are moving away from each other, the time of closest approach would be 0. 
In this case, the time to interaction is considered to be infinite so that interactions which represent convergent motion dominate the computation.
Pearlitic steels are characterized by high strength, hardness and creep resistance at room temperature. 
Furthermore, when deformed above the yield limit they show a higher hardening rate than most ferritic steels while presenting acceptable levels of ductility _CITE_. 
The reason behind these unique mechanical properties can be traced back to the microstructure. 
Pearlitic steels have a carbon content that is close to the eutectoid composition (0.76 weight percent), which yields a microstructure composed of closely spaced cementite and ferrite layers. 
It is this particular microstructure of soft ferrite packed between hard cementite walls that leads to the high strength and hardening of pearlitic steels _CITE_. 
These properties make pearlitic steels ideal candidates for applications such as railways, springs and wires/cables where structural integrity and minimum irreversible deformation over time are required for the entire service life. 
Moreover, in the case of drawn wires the high strain hardening behavior of pearlitic steels allows to reach high strength levels _CITE_.
The CDP-1(_MATH_) prior modifies (_REF_)-(_REF_) to let _MATH_ independently for _MATH_, with _MATH_, and _MATH_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The CDP-1 prior has the advantage of using a diagonal centering transformation, which allows the elements in specific locations of _MATH_ to be maintained. 
In contrast, the multiplication by the non-diagonal _MATH_ in line 2 of expression (_REF_) does not allow pre-specified zero elements for reasons that will become clear. 
We follow Ishwaran and James (2001) in using a finite approximation that lets _MATH_, implying that terms _MATH_ can be discarded. 
Here, _MATH_ can be viewed as an upper bound on the number of latent classes. 
The approximation to _MATH_ is referred to as _MATH_.
Given two Lie groupoids _MATH_ and _MATH_, a morphism of Lie groupoids is a smooth map _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ and _MATHDISP_. 
A morphism of Lie groupoids _MATH_ induces a smooth map _MATH_ in such a way that _MATHDISP_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_) being the source, the target and the identity section of _MATH_ (resp., _MATH_).
Consider the probability that the _MATH_ lineage experiences a mutation at time _MATH_. 
For such an event to occur, a _MATH_ mutation must occur and the resultant _MATH_ variant must be in the _MATH_ lineage. 
The rate of _MATH_ mutations is given by _MATH_ which is trivially bounded by _MATH_. 
By symmetry the _MATH_ variant resulting from a mutation is in _MATH_ with probability _MATH_. 
By Proposition _REF_, for _MATH_ this probability is bounded above by _MATH_. 
From this we have, _MATHDISP_. 
In the last line above we have used the result _MATH_. 
To see this note that after _MATH_, the _MATH_ variants expand deterministically. 
Arguments similar to those used in Proposition _REF_ show that _MATH_ will push _MATH_ to _MATH_ levels in _MATH_ time.
The total work on the production of value in unit of time is the sum of work of substitution _MATH_, measured in power units, and works of humans _MATH_, where _MATH_ is an estimate of work of one person per hour (see Section 2.4.1). 
The total can be recorded as _MATHDISP_, This work fulfils 'useful' changes in our environment (in the form of useful consumer goods and services), which can be estimated by production of value _MATH_ (in money units, for year, for example), written, in virtue of relations (6.17) and (6.18), as _MATHDISP_. 
If value is estimated by monetary units of constant purchasing capacity, marginal productivities _MATH_ and _MATH_ depend on production factors. 
On a choice of monetary unit with constant 'energy content', marginal productivities appear to be constant.
Since the representation defining a _MATH_-frame is unitary, i.e., _MATHDISP_, the Gramian of a _MATH_-frame _MATH_ has a special form: _MATHDISP_. 
Thus the Gramian of a _MATH_-frame is a group matrix or _MATH_-matrix, i.e., a matrix _MATH_, with entries indexed by elements of a group _MATH_, which has the form _MATHDISP_. 
One important consequence of the fact the Gramian of a _MATH_-frame is a group matrix is that it has a small number of angles: _MATH_, which makes them good candidates for equiangular tight frames (see S_REF_). 
We have the characterisation (_CITE_):
Estimations on the SSA feasibility with the new generator of polarized DY events
As expected, the steady-state behaviour is similar to motorcycles, see e.g. _CITE_. 
The different lines in the graph are-except for the roll angle _MATH_, as differences are marginal-indicated with the respective velocity. 
The diagram can be read in various ways. 
Besides the handling curve _MATH_, for a given longitudinal velocity, e.g. the required tilting angle _MATH_ to negotiate a curve with a desired radius of curvature _MATH_ (with known wheel base _MATH_) can be directly read off the diagram. 
Further, the respective ground steering angle _MATH_ can than be obtained with _MATH_. 
Additionally, the corresponding normalized normal (centrifugal) acceleration _MATH_ of reference point _MATH_ of the vehicle and the required steering torque _MATH_ can be found, as well as the side slip angles _MATH_ and _MATH_ of the front and substitutive rear tyre, respectively.
The CMB shift parameter _MATH_ is given by _CITE_ _MATHDISP_ which is related to the second distance ratio _MATH_ by a factor _MATH_. 
Here the redshift _MATH_ (the decoupling epoch of photons) is obtained by using the fitting function _CITE_ _MATHDISP_, where the functions _MATH_ and _MATH_ are given as _MATHDISP_. 
The 5-year WMAP data of _MATH_ _CITE_ will be used as constraint from CMB, then the _MATH_ is given as _MATHDISP_.
The method is applied to a three-dimensional descriptor system with three a priori undetermined relations describing the fluctuation growth, frequency and mean-field correction as functions of the fluctuation energy. 
As a benchmark problem we chose the onset of laminar von Karman vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder. 
Results of a direct numerical simulation are transcribed into the mode amplitudes of a minimal 3-state Galerkin model _CITE_ which are then captured with remarkable accuracy by our identified descriptor system. 
The form of the reconstructed system is marked by a noticeable departure from the mean-field models and may therefore guide the refinement of the latter by inclusion of higher-order terms. 
We emphasize that the usefulness of reduced-order models for flow control applications may in fact depend on such differences.
The approach for face profile recognition is shown in Figure _REF_. 
First, face profile is extracted from facial images. 
Second, The scale space filtering is used to smooth the profile and then the curvature of the filtered profile is computed. 
Using the curvature value, the fiducial points, such as nasion and throat can be reliably extracted using a fast method. 
Finally, a dynamic time warping method is applied to match the face profile portion from nasion to throat based on the curvature value. 
The reason for choosing dynamic time warping as the matching method is that it is a robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis _CITE_.
This situation has thoroughly changed. 
Nowadays it is rarely called into question that the assessment of "tail risks" requires specific methods and that extreme value theory often (though not always) offers efficient and mathematically sound procedures to deal with such problems. 
Moreover, several smooth introductions both to general extreme value statistics and to its application to actuarial problems have been published; see, e.g., Embrechts et al. (1997), Beirlant et al. (2004), McNeil (1997) and Cebrian et al. (2003). 
For that reason, the present paper focusses on specific aspects which have perhaps not attracted the attention they deserve:
Thanks to its power of expressivity, the regular PN makes it possible to describe parallelism, dependency and semaphores, which present important properties of ERTS. 
In spite of this significant ability, regular PNs are not able to model the temporal evolution of ERTS. 
That is why the regular PN is extended to Time Petri Net.
On the other hand, many real-world systems may have more than one class of customers (or jobs) in their queueing models. 
A multiclass queueing network (MQN) model has been developed for the analysis of such systems. 
The MQN, like the GJN, cannot be analyzed in a closed form for stationary distribution; accordingly, various approximations and bounds have been developed. 
In particular, owing to the heavily loaded situations that frequently occur in real-world systems, considerable research has been conducted to develop heavy traffic approximations for MQN. 
In anticipation of heavy traffic limit theorems, Harrison and Nguyen _CITE_ proposed a Brownian model of the MQN in heavy traffic where the workload process in the network is replaced by a reflected Brownian motion (RBM). 
This replacement is motivated by the fact that various quantities for RBM such as the stationary distribution can be computed either exactly or numerically. 
However, the purported limits in _CITE_ lack the rigorously theoretical background. 
In fact, some studies have provided counterexamples to the Brownian approximations (e.g. Dai and Wang _CITE_). 
Therefore, the identification of the category of the MQNs for which heavy traffic limit approximations are valid is one of the outstanding open problems in the research conducted on this topic.
It is best to add the _MATH_ and _MATH_ currents together before inferring the field strengths they induce, so we derive them together. 
From expression (_REF_) we see that _MATH_ vanishes because the classical charge density is zero for a point magnetic dipole. 
Substituting the other classical values (_REF_-_REF_) into expression (_REF_) and performing some partial integrations reduces the induced _MATH_-type current density to a single integral over conformal time, _MATHDISP_. 
Of course the temporal component of _MATH_ always vanishes. 
From expression (_REF_) and the classical relation _MATH_ we infer, _MATHDISP_.
And we have the following semiclassical limit: 
For any _MATH_, any _MATH_, and any _MATH_ we have: _MATHDISP_ 
We denote _MATH_ and _MATH_ the ball of center _MATH_ and radius _MATH_ and by _MATH_ its complementary set. 
Take _MATH_. 
We have: _MATHDISP_ 
It is clear that the first term in the right hand side tends to 0 as _MATH_ because of Proposition (_REF_) (i). 
For the second term we denote _MATH_. 
We have: _MATHDISP_. 
Using the resolution of identity we have that _MATHDISP_ Using Proposition (_REF_) (ii) the first term in the right hand side tends to 1 as _MATH_, and it is clear that the second is small as _MATH_. 
This completes the proof.
Another kind of modification of this same CF-function has been proposed in _CITE_. 
It is based on a well-known general construction of bent functions due to Dillon _CITE_. 
The resulting "Tu-Deng function" is defined over _MATH_ (it is therefore a _MATH_-variable function) and maps _MATH_ to _MATH_, where _MATH_ is the CF-function. 
Note that _MATH_ equals _MATH_ when _MATH_ and is null when _MATH_. 
The Tu-Deng function is bent (and therefore has optimal nonlinearity _MATH_) and its AI has optimal value _MATH_, up to a combinatorial conjecture which is still an open problem nowadays (see _CITE_), but which has been checked up to _MATH_ (this is plenty enough for the cryptographic application: 58 variables is much larger than what is needed). 
This bent function is obviously not balanced but, as shown in _CITE_, it can be modified into a function with optimal AI as well, and large nonlinearity by modifying _MATH_ output values. 
Unfortunately, it has been proved in _CITE_ that these functions (and all functions modified from bent functions) have bad behavior against fast algebraic attacks since their Hamming distance to functions of degrees at most _MATH_ is small (we know from _CITE_ that any _MATH_-variable bent function has algebraic degree at most _MATH_).
In this work, beyond the ground state (pseudo)scalar mesons, we also consider the first excited (pseudo)scalar states and we investigate the case in which also in this sector a negative squared mass is present. 
As we shall argue, for some parameter choice this possibility cannot be excluded and leads to a more complicated scenario, in which ground-state and first-excited scalar and pseudoscalar mesons mix. 
Moreover, for some parameter choice it is possible that also one neutral pseudoscalar pionic field condenses, thus realizing a spontaneous symmetry breaking of parity.
In this section, we first propose a new character field function which considers not only particle-fluid surface complexity, but also particle-boundary interaction, physical complexity and the complementary consition. 
We then discuss the adaptive sampling rules.
Let _MATH_ be a KKT point of Problem (_REF_) then _MATH_ is a stationary point of Problem (_REF_).
Let's calculate the Malmsten's integral _REF_ by means of formula _REF_. 
Function _MATH_, being a rational function of _MATH_, fulfill with no doubts _REF_. 
Besides, it is a meromorphic function having two simple poles within the strip _MATH_ at points _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Taking additionally into account that _MATH_ is even, _REF_ gives: _MATHDISP_. 
In the last line we may easily recognize the Malmsten's general formula _REF_. 
Making _MATH_, we arrive at _REF_ as follows: _MATHDISP_, where the final simplification is done with the help of the reflection formula for the _MATH_-function. 
The final response is, therefore, completely expressed in terms of mathematical constants.
The simulation results (Section _REF_) show that the type of model considered (model g2) does induce the kind of travel-time shifts observed. 
These are then seen by both the travel-time shifts measured from the simulation and by ray theory calculated with the model used. 
It is unfortunate that the modification to the solar model to stablize it has such a large effect on the resulting _MATH_.
Phenomena associated with neutrino masses, and with gravity, are commonly regarded as beyond, or at least outside, the standard model. 
Of course, where one draws the boundary of the standard model is largely a matter of taste. 
But it's appropriate to emphasize that our working descriptions both of neutrino masses and of gravity fit smoothly and naturally into the conceptual framework associated with the "core" standard model of strong and electroweak interactions. 
Specifically, neutrino masses can be accommodated using dimension 5 operators, and gravity through the Einstein-Hilbert curvature term and minimal coupling to matter (we can also include a cosmological term). 
The deep guiding principles that underlie the standard model, to wit local quantum field theory based on operators of the lowest available mass dimension, also work to give theories of neutrino masses and of gravity that describe all existing observations in terms of a small number of parameters.
Proof: 
With the choice of _MATH_ and _MATH_ above, the time derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate _MATH_ is negative semidefinite. 
Global asymptotic stability of _MATH_ and _MATH_ can be concluded _CITE_, i.e. _MATH_, _MATH_ and the vessel position _MATH_ converges to the desired position _MATH_ asymptotically.
Application to Partial Fractional Differential Equations
A Meta-heuristic Approach to Two Dimensional Recursive Digital Filter Design
After normalizing these parameters, we get: _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ denotes the unit placement cost of region _MATH_ after normalization and _MATH_, expressing the client density of region _MATH_.
SOHO/EIT has been the primary first-generation EUV wave imager for over a solar cycle. 
Unfortunately, its operational 12 - 18 minute cadence significantly under-samples the typically hour-long lifetimes of EIT waves and results in large uncertainties in their kinematics measurements. 
Such observations led to under-constrained models and considerable controversy. 
TRACE _CITE_ had much higher cadences of 20 - 30 seconds and the best spatial resolution [_MATH_] to date, but its small field of view (FOV) made it incapable of tracking global EUV waves and its long exposures can smear rapidly evolving features. 
As such, TRACE detected only a handful EIT waves during its 12 year mission ( e.g. _CITE_).
First, we observe that due to the geometry of the non-square state, any list _MATH_ intersects with only half of the _MATH_. 
For instance, the first list _MATH_ associated to the first column of state _REF_S7 intersects with lists _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
We represent this property with a _MATH_ array on _REF_: the 16 columns correspond to the 16 lists _MATH_ and the lines to the _MATH_, _MATH_. 
The cell _MATH_ is white if and only if _MATH_ has a non-null intersection with the list _MATH_, otherwise it is gray.
(3) Consider an independent set _MATH_ and distinct elements _MATH_ such that _MATHDISP_ are bases of _MATH_, with _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_. 
Then for any _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATHDISP_.
Conversely, if _MATH_, then there exists an analytic function _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
Then, we consider a function of the form _MATHDISP_ which is a holomorphic function in the strip _MATH_ and is a continuous function on the closure _MATH_. 
By the maximum principle, it is obtained that _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, _MATHDISP_. 
Consequently, _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Furthermore, taking the infimum of _MATH_ for all possible _MATH_'s, we have _MATHDISP_.
In the previous section we observed that a general transformation contains cycles, and even and odd paths in the Adjacency Graph (AG) as first discussed by Bergeron, Mixtacki and Stoye _CITE_ who introduced the AG. 
We went on to discuss how each of these components contributes to the DCJ distance, noting that the paths can be circularized by the addition of caps (for odd paths) and both caps and null chromosomes (for even paths). 
This circularization procedure using the original closure rules is achieved by the use of "fictitious" elements, but it is still possible to use the formalism for permutations as we did for pure circular genomes. 
Just as in the strictly circular case, since we've circularized all paths, all cycles will double when we go to the permutation cycles for the composition permutation. 
In addition, the vertices in the permutations will be twice the number of adjacencies. 
Hence since the algebraic distance is half of the norm for the permutation cycles, we find that the algebraic distance using capped genomes with nulls is the same as the DCJ distance.
Model execution involves intially placing brood elements at random locations in the rectangular grid. 
Subsequently, agents start moving randomly and the associated system dynamics resulting from agent states and the respective agent behaviours come into force. 
This simple model includes only two basic dynamic processes concerning brood element collection and deposition respectively. 
Both processes highly depend on the environmental conditions, and primarily on the brood element density found at the various locations around the environment. 
When wandering agents encounter a brood element at some location, they decide to collect it with some probability. 
This action will slightly reduce brood element concentration in the area surrounding that location, which will in turn result to subsequent agents collecting the remaining brood elements from that area with higher probability (see agent behavioural rules above). 
In a similar manner, agents carrying brood elements will deposit them at locations with sufficient brood element density, which according to the agent behavioural rules will reinforce the probability of other agents subsequently depositing additional brood elements in the surrounding area. 
In this manner, isolated brood elements quickly turn into brood element piles, and furthermore small piles tend to be merged into larger ones.
Concerning the effect of the number of projections we wish to mention that the conservative character of the procedure proposed in Proposition _REF_ clearly appears under the null: in the three tables, in practically every cell corresponding to the null, the proportions decrease with _MATH_. 
Interestingly, the opposite happens under the alternative, excluding some cells in Table _REF_ for low values of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
The reason for this could be that, when _MATH_ increases, the chance of finding a direction in which the alternative appears more strongly increases and this increment overcomes the conservativeness of the procedure. 
However, this chance becomes smaller when _MATH_ is great in comparison with the real dimension of the data. 
This is what led us to limit _MATH_ being, as most, equal to the dimension of the data (see Section _REF_).
We start this section with a discussion of normal MT based on the Chaikin subdivision scheme which after linear spline subdivision is the next member of the family of B-spline subdivision schemes of order _MATH_ given by the operator _MATH_ with mask _MATHDISP_. 
It is well-known that the limit function _MATH_ of the delta sequence _MATHDISP_ is exactly the B-spline of order _MATH_ with support in the interval _MATH_. 
The order of polynomial reproduction of _MATH_ is _MATH_, and its Holder smoothness is _MATH_ with _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Since the mask _MATH_ is positive, for the order of polynomial exactness we have _MATH_ for any _MATH_, with _MATH_ for odd _MATH_, and _MATH_ otherwise.
Remark: 
The sufficient condition _MATH_ of above theorems is closed to that given by IHT _CITE_ (_MATH_) and better than that given by CoSaMP _CITE_ (_MATH_). 
On the other hand, the condition given by GHTP is worse than that given by HTP _CITE_ (_MATH_). 
It could be seen as the penalty of the unknown sparsity level. 
As pointed by _CITE_, testing whether a matrix satisfies RIP is NP-hard. 
Thus, the RIC bound in each paper is only the theoretical hypothesis.
Let _MATH_ be a reflexive Banach space with norm _MATH_. 
Let _MATH_ be an adjoint space of _MATH_ with norm _MATH_, their duality product on _MATH_ being denoted by _MATH_. 
We want to generalize Theorem _REF_ to the sectorial operators of Banach spaces. 
But, this is possible only partly.
Let (_REF_) and (_REF_) hold, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Assume that _MATH_ is a positive solution of (_REF_) satisfying (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
If _MATHDISP_, then every nonoscillatory solution of (_REF_) satisfies the property (_REF_). 
Let (_REF_) hold, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
Assume that _MATH_ is a positive solution of (_REF_) satisfying (_REF_) and (_REF_). 
If (_REF_) and (_REF_) hold, then every nonoscillatory solution of (_REF_) tends to zero as _MATH_. 
Consider (_REF_) again. 
By Corollary _REF_, every nonoscillatory solution of (_REF_) tends to zero as _MATH_, provided that the integration given in Example _REF_ holds and _MATHDISP_. 
For a special case of (_REF_), namely, for _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_ and _MATH_, we get that every nonoscillatory solution of this equation tends to zero as _MATH_ provided that _MATHDISP_. 
If we set _MATH_, where _MATH_, then one such solution of (_REF_) is _MATH_. 
On the other hand, if for some _MATH_, we have _MATH_, then (_REF_) is violated, and (_REF_) has a nonoscillatory solution _MATH_ which is of degree 2.
The ESS provides a numerical value for the effective sample size of a given prior. 
If one wishes to utilize this methodology to construct a prior having a given ESS, two important cases may be identified. 
When designing a small to moderate sized clinical trial using Bayesian methods, it is desirable that the prior ESS be small enough so that early decisions are dominated by the data (e.g. the first cohort of 3 patients in a dose-finding study) rather than the prior. 
In this case, an ESS in the range 0.5 to 2.0 may be appropriate. 
On the other hand, if one is eliciting a prior for analysis of a given data set of _MATH_ observations, then a desirable ESS may be specified relative to _MATH_. 
In this case, an ESS of .10 _MATH_ or smaller might be appropriate.
The second effect is the overlapping area on the solar surface that is simultaneously seen by both spacecraft STEREO/A and B, which decreases linearly with the spacecraft separation angle from 50% at _MATH_ (with _MATH_ at the start of spacecraft separation) to 0% at _MATH_ (with _MATH_ at maximum separation), and then increases linearly again for the next quarter phase of a mission cycle. 
If we fold the variation _MATH_ of the solar cycle (Equation 11) with the triangular stereoscopic overlap area variation _MATH_ together, we obtain a statistical probability for the number of stereoscopically triangulable active regions. 
However, the number of accurate stereoscopical triangulations scales with the quality factor _MATH_ (Equation 10), where the spacecraft separation angle _MATH_ is a piece-wise linear (triangular) function of time _MATH_ according to the spacecraft orbit. 
Essentially we are assuming that the probability of successfull stereoscopic triangulations at a given time scales with the quality factor or feasibility of accurate stereoscopy at this time. 
So, we obtain a combined probability of stereoscopically triangulable active regions of, _MATHDISP_. 
In Figure 9 we show this combined statistical probability of feasible stereoscopy in terms of the expected number of active regions for a full mission cycle of 16 years, from 2006 to 2022. 
It shows that the best periods for solar stereoscopy are during 2012-2014, 2016-2017, and 2021-2023.
In this paper we proposed a proactive approach based optimization model for cooling systems of the datacenters. 
The proactive approach is based on having advanced knowledge of the workload behavior and taking an appropriate action before the heat imbalance affects the temperature. 
When we compared the proactive approach with the reactive approach, reactive approach was found to have many disadvantages such as delayed response, high risk of over heating, excessive cooling and recursive cycling. 
Proactive approach proposed in this paper overcomes these disadvantages of the reactive approach. 
Proactive approach cools the system before temperature rises and prevents any occurrence of "risk of overheating" and also prevents "excessive cooling" as the heat imbalance is estimated based on the knowledge of subsystem usage and the workloads. 
For it to be effective there is a need for multiples fans under each plenum for each aisle or each corridor, which is possible with minimal or no changes to the designs of the existing datacenters. 
Multiple fans help in effectively controlling hot spots occurring in different locations, which cannot be eliminated by the current single fan cooling systems even by using proactive approach. 
The use of multiple fans in the proactive approach to control the cooling system saves approximately 4% to 10% of the energy required for cooling, depending on the workload and scheduling algorithms implemented.
These intricate dynamics attracted significant attention among some theoreticians _CITE_. 
In particular, Babloyantz and Sanglier formulated a model of growth on TMG/succinate which took due account of enzyme synthesis by the Jacob-Monod mechanism, and enzyme depletion by degradation _CITE_. 
They showed that the model yielded the bistability observed in experiments. 
Chung and Stephanopoulos formulated a similar model, the main differences being that repressor-operator and repressor-inducer binding were assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium, and the enzyme was depleted by both degradation and dilution _CITE_. 
This model is given by the equations _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ and _MATH_ denote the intracellular and extracellular TMG concentrations, respectively; _MATH_ denotes the lac permease activity; _MATH_ is the specific growth rate on the non-galactosidic carbon source; _MATH_- denote the specific rates of TMG uptake and expulsion, respectively; and _MATH_- denote the specific rates of permease synthesis and degradation, respectively. 
The expression for _MATH_ is based on the molecular model formulated by Yagil and Yagil, which assumes that the lac operon contains one operator, and the lac repressor contains identical two inducer-binding sites _CITE_. 
The parameter, _MATH_, is the association constant for the repressor-inducer binding; and _MATH_ is jointly proportional to the intracellular repressor level and the association constant for repressor-operator binding. 
Evidently, _MATH_ is a measure of the repression, defined as the ratio, _MATH_.
Figure _REF_ illustrates the computation of deformation vector by vertex-image-segment matching. 
As shown in the figure, a vertex is projected onto each image plane with the camera parameters as illustrated by green circles and dashed lines. 
Here the focus is on image _MATH_. 
A vertex-image-segment of projected vertex _MATH_, _MATH_, is extracted from _MATH_ as represented by the red polygonal region. 
Then, it is transformed onto the image plane of camera _MATH_, which is denoted by a transformed vertex-image-segment, _MATH_ as shown in the figure. 
The best match position of _MATH_ around _MATH_ on _MATH_ is sought where the image appearances of _MATH_ and _MATH_ are the most similar to each other. 
The best match position is denoted _MATH_, which is illustrated by a filled circle near the projected vertex _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
If the 3D shape and the camera parameters were perfectly accurate, _MATH_ would coincide with _MATH_, i.e.. the projected position of vertex _MATH_ on the image plane of _MATH_. 
In practice, however, _MATH_ is located away from _MATH_ due to errors in the calibration and shape reconstruction. 
The displacement from _MATH_ to _MATH_ is denoted by the deformation vector _MATH_. 
Note that a set of deformation vectors are computed for each projected vertex on each image; the displacements change depending on which projected vertex is used as key reference point. 
Algorithm _REF_ shows the procedure described above in detail.
_CITE_ developed the first model capable of fitting simultaneously the observed four helioseismic spectra (_MATH_ and _MATH_ power, and _MATH_ phase difference and coherence). 
This model is based on coherent components, which have fixed phase relation between the associated _MATH_ and _MATH_ fluctuations, and on correlated components, which have fixed phase relation to the mode. 
The coherent ( c) component includes: the p mode, a fraction of the solar background that is correlated with the p mode, and a fraction of the background that is still coherent but uncorrelated with the mode; finally, there is an incoherent component or noise.
Using the entangling operator _MATH_, under this preparation, a pure entangled state _MATH_ on _MATH_ (i.e. a normalized vector _MATH_ in _MATH_) can be achieved as _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_ and _MATH_ with marginals _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ in _MATH_ is given by _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_and _MATH_. 
We know that the normalized vector _MATH_ is represented in the decomposed form (_REF_) due to the following simple computation: _MATHDISP_, i.e., _MATH_ is the purification of _MATH_ given above. 
So we have _MATHDISP_ Note that the marginal density _MATH_ has the symmetry property with respect to the complex conjugation _MATH_as _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, that is a "_MATH_-complex conjugation" operation. 
Since _MATH_ is the marginal state of _MATH_ having a diagonal representation _MATH_ in the standard base in _MATH_.
Since _MATH_ is a symmetric matrix it is diagonalizable. 
As a result, because _MATH_, and _MATH_ has multiplicity one _MATH_ must have at least two distinct eigenvalues. 
If _MATH_ has exactly two eigenvalues _MATH_ we have _MATH_ and thus _MATH_. 
In this case we claim _MATH_ for some real number _MATH_. 
The reason is that every nonzero vector ortogonal to _MATH_ is an eigenvector of _MATH_ with eigenvalue _MATH_ so the rows of _MATH_ are scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. 
Since this matrix must be symmetric it is therefore a multiple of _MATH_ as claimed. 
Taking traces we have _MATH_ and thus _MATH_ is a multiple of _MATH_.
As an alternative modeling framework _CITE_ suggested specifying models for _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ and maximizing _MATH_ jointly to provide a consistent framework for FI and PI models. 
With their approach each detection function is observer-specific rather than a mix of conditional observer-specific detection functions (e.g.,_MATH_) and a detection function (_MATH_) that combines observers. 
The only challenge was to develop a model for _MATH_ that could represent FI and PI and which provided valid probabilities for computed quantities like _MATH_. 
They used the following representation for _MATH_: _MATHDISP_ where _MATHDISP_. 
The lower bound _MATH_ on _MATH_ ensures probabilities do not exceed 1 and the upper bound _MATH_ ensures non-negative probabilities: _MATHDISP_. 
This formulation ensures _MATH_ and FI is achieved with _MATH_. 
In most cases, only positive dependence is likely because the observers are affected in a similar manner by detection probability heterogeneity. 
By setting _MATH_ to zero and restricting _MATH_ by using _MATH_ for _MATH_, positive dependence (_MATH_) is enforced. 
Enforcing positive dependence ensures that the conditional detection probability function _MATH_ is monotone; whereas non-monotone functions are possible without the restriction. 
With positive dependence, _MATH_ is: _MATHDISP_. 
Various functional forms could be used to represent _MATH_ but we will use the logistic form used by _CITE_: _MATHDISP_. 
The functional forms of both _MATH_ and _MATH_ can easily incorporate additional covariates other than distance _MATH_. 
If covariates are added to _MATH_ they must be an interaction with distance to ensure _MATH_. 
Alternate forms for _MATH_ (_CITE_) such as: _MATHDISP_, may be useful to maintain strict monotonicity with distance when covariates are added to either the intercept or scale; however, defining models becomes slightly more complex because covariates can be used in p(0) or for the scale function for distance or both. 
The removal-distance sampling model of _CITE_ used this alternate form where they specified _MATH_. 
A similar logistic model could be specified using (_REF_) where _MATH_.
Let _MATH_ i.e., _MATH_ is precisely the union of the one element orbits of _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
If _MATH_, then the equation (_REF_) is reduced to _MATHDISP_
Namely, for a two-dimensional system of ordinary equations and a particular case of boundary conditions we get
The BDS is written at the beginning of the block(s) that we are writing. 
The _REF_entries member is the array of table entries for the lowest level page table, and _REF_parent_table is the sector address of the upper level table. 
_REF_numblocks represents the number of blocks that follow the BDS. 
Usually this is 1, but if there are many contiguous blocks that belong to the same group of 32 table entries, it is possible to string many blocks together. 
_REF_end_of_log is a flag that is set if this block represents the end of the log. 
Since we only write new blocks to the end of the log, the _REF_end_of_log flag is always set for new writes. 
However, this would mean that _REF_end_of_log flag is always set and never cleared. 
To address that, we instead always set _REF_end_of_log in the BDS to 0, and then write a dummy BDS at the end of the blocks with _REF_end_of_log set to 1. 
Subsequent writes to the end of the log will then overwrite this dummy BDS. 
Thus, a write to a new block will require writing the block itself plus 2 BDS writes - the current BDS at the beggining and the dummy BDS at tned. In the worst case, with a write to a single 4K block, that represents a 20% increase in data transfer size. 
However, since the write is contiguous, it is unlikely to represent any significant effect on performance.
Our prototype compiler currently handles two common patterns of irregular reduction loops. 
In Code _REF_(a), array data is accessed via index array index. 
This type of reduction is often called histogram reduction. 
We refer this pattern as type 1 reduction. 
The other pattern, type 2 reduction, in Code _REF_(b) is similar to the compressed row storage (CRS) format which appears in sparse matrix codes. 
In this pattern, the data array is referenced both regularly and irregularly by the induction variable and index array neighbors, respectively.
We analyze the variations in the near-surface profiles of sound-speed and adiabatic constant between active regions and neighboring quiet-Sun areas using the technique of ring-diagram analysis and inversions of the frequency differences between the regions. 
This approach minimizes the systematic observational effects on the fitted spectral model parameters. 
The regions analyzed have been selected from a large sample of data available from both GONG and MDI, and include a wide range of magnetic activity levels as measured in several respects. 
We find that the thermal structure anomalies under active regions have a consistent depth profile, with only the magnitude of the effect varying with the intensity of the active regions. 
Both the sound speed and the first adiabatic index are depressed near the surface, but enhanced at greater depths. 
The turnover for the sound speed occurs at a shallower depth than that for the adiabatic index. 
The amplitude of the thermal anomalies at all depths correlates more closely with the total magnetic flux of the active regions than with spot areas or flare activity levels. 
The depth of the turnover does not appear to depend on the strength of the region.
As described above, without treatment, the population is composed of individuals infected with strain 1 or strain 2 (the case in which one individual is infected by both strains is not allowed in this model). 
In this case treating the dominant strain 1 will result in increasing the proportion of individuals infected with strain 2. 
This is shown below in Fig. _REF_. 
It can be observed that when _MATH_ day_MATH_ and _MATH_ day_MATH_, both strains coexist at proportions of _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
As _MATH_ increases up to _MATH_ day_MATH_, virus 1, the dominant strain, is driven to extinction and is supplanted by virus 2, which attains a prevalence of _MATH_. 
Note that since virus 1 is completely eliminated, virus 2 acts independently, and its prevalence is given by the usual formula _MATH_, where _MATH_. 
When the treatment is less than 100% efficient, the situation is very complicated, as described in Appendix 2.
Each region analyzed is tracked for 8192 minutes centered on its central meridian crossing, at the photospheric rotation rate appropriate to its latitude. 
For the latitudes involved, ranging from _MATH_ to _MATH_, the maximum displacement in longitude of the tracked region with reference to the Carrington system over the interval of tracking is _MATH_, considerably smaller than either the diameter of the regions tracked or the typical longitudinal extent of an active region. 
The tracked regions are mapped to a plane using Postel's (azimuthal equidistant) projection. 
For the MDI data, we subtract a long-term mean (over a Carrington rotation) from the data; this removes a constant term in the slowly varying orbital velocity, and first-order terms in solar rotation and spatial variations in the MDI calibration error. 
For the GONG data, in order to merge without discontinuities, we make explicit corrections for the Earth orbital and rotational velocity applicable to each site, as well as for a model solar rotational velocity. 
The power spectra of the resultant tracked cubes are fitted using the 13-parameter model of Basu and Antia (1999) which takes into account the asymmetry of the peaks in the power spectrum.
From the Hamiltonian (_REF_), we obtain the continuity equation outside the region of the well, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are respectively the charge operator average at site _MATH_ and the current operator average at the bond linking the sites _MATH_ and _MATH_, defined as _MATHDISP_. 
Through the Keldysh formalism we reduce the non-equilibrium current _MATH_ above into an equation that depends on the retarded Green functions of the system. 
We use Dyson equation and a process of decimation to find these retarded Green functions. 
In this process, we consider all states at the DBH and the phonon emission for a given _MATH_ that occurs in the well.
To finish our example, suppose that _MATH_ and that we have used three FFT's with 100, 101, and 103 samples to determine that _MATH_ mod _MATH_, _MATH_ mod _MATH_, and _MATH_ mod 103, respectively. 
Using that _MATH_ mod 103 we can see that _MATH_ for some integer _MATH_. 
Using this new expression for _MATH_ in our second modulus we get _MATHDISP_. 
Therefore, _MATH_ for some integer _MATH_. 
Substituting for _MATH_ we get that _MATH_. 
By similar work we can see that _MATH_ mod _MATH_ after considering _MATH_ modulo 100. 
Hence, _MATH_ by the CRT. 
As an added bonus we note that our three FFTs will have also provided us with three different estimates of _MATH_'s coefficient _MATH_.
Second order condition _MATH_ 
There exists a positive real parameter _MATH_, a negative real parameter _MATH_ and a function _MATH_ with _MATH_ for _MATH_, of constant sign for large values of _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_.
Phishing has been recently used as a mean to deploy MitM attacks against two Finnish banks, Nordea and Osuuspankki, at the beginning of September 2011 _CITE_. 
This attack was fairly straightforward: the victim received an email that pretended to be from their bank, and that contained a link to the server used by the attacker as MitM. 
It was an exact copy of the web site of the real banks, and was hosted in France. 
Similar attacks have also been carried out against the Swedish branch of Nordea in October 2005 and against Citibank in July 2006 _CITE_.
Here _MATH_ , _MATH_ is the time constant of the _MATH_-APF and we restrict _MATH_ or _MATH_. 
To simplify the analysis we shall assume that when _MATH_-APF and _MATH_-FAPF_MATH_ are employed they are all of the leading phase or lagging phase type, to reduce the number of possible permutations and combinations that are possible. 
To satisfy the Barkhausen criterion for oscillation the loop gain (LG) must meet _MATH_ which yields the following gain equation _MATHDISP_ at a phase shift that must satisfy _MATHDISP_ for circuits having a leading phase angle and _MATHDISP_ at a phase shift of _MATHDISP_ for circuits have a lagging phase. 
To that end, let us consider three possible design scenarios as initially mentioned in Section _REF_. 
Note they are in no way exhaustive of the capabilities of oscillators made using combinations of FAPFs and APFs, but are used to illustrate the versatility of the fractional allpass filter block.
Recent work _CITE_ explains that a broken power-law spectrum at the Earth is created from a single power-law injected electron spectrum if the generation and absorption of Langmuir waves are taken into account. 
Specifically the broken power-law forms as a combined process between the electron beam inducing Langmuir waves and the density inhomogeneity changing the phase velocity of the Langmuir waves. 
Above the break energy the electron beam is too dilute to generate Langmuir waves in the background plasma. 
However, below the break, Langmuir wave interaction with the electrons flattens the electron distribution function in velocity space. 
As the result, the peak flux and fluence spectrum flattens with the density inhomogeneity controlling the flattening.
Figure 3 shows the evolution of NOAA 10488's area, total flux, and contribution and dimensional contributions over five days, from 27 October to 1 November 2007. 
The initial flux emergence is characterized by a small increase in the multifractal parameters on 27 October 2005. 
This results from the emergence of isolated small-scale flux elements which subsequently coalesce to form a number of large-scale structures with reduced significance. 
The multifractal properties of the region then remain constant for a number of hours as the region continues to grow in size and total flux.
Lifetime utility of the representative household, denoted by _MATH_, takes a simple logarithmic form: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is full consumption, which is defined as the sum of the value of goods consumption and the opportunity cost of leisure consumption. 
We have already imposed that the household's pure rate of time preference is equal to the rate of interest._MATH_ 
Following Greenwood et al. (1988), the full consumption sub-utility functional is specified so as to eliminate the wealth effect in the household's labor force participation decision: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is private consumption, _MATH_ denotes labor force participation, and _MATH_ is the intratemporal labor supply elasticity. 
Labor supply is exogenous if _MATH_ and endogenous if _MATH_.
The kinematics of the wave leading edge, the wave peak, a rarefaction dip, and the piston, measured from the density profiles shown in Figure _REF_, are displayed in Figure _REF_, revealing that the piston accelerates until _MATH_. 
Thereafter, it continues to move at an approximately constant speed of _MATH_ until _MATH_. 
During this period the wave amplitude increases (see Figure _REF_) and the wave-crest phase speed increases from _MATH_ to _MATH_. 
At the same time, the wavefront leading edge moves at _MATH_. 
The wave crest reaches the leading edge, i.e. the shock formation is completed, around _MATH_. 
After that, the shock front moves at a speed of _MATH_, consistent with the Rankine-Hugoniot jump relations. 
The described evolution of the source/wave system and its kinematics is fully consistent with the analytical model presented by _CITE_.
Find the "unit cell" of the cascaded system. 
Isolate the elements that are not in common (not shared: _MATH_) and the elements that are shared through the cascading (touch each other: _MATH_).
Total Heat generated _MATH_ _MATH_ by the processor and subsystems in blade, over the time _MATH_ is given by, _MATHDISP_. 
From (_REF_), we observe that _MATH_ is directly proportional to the product of power utilized by the processor and subsystems _MATH_ and the time _MATH_ when the processor and subsystems are "on'.
Proof: Consider the following Lyapunov function _MATHDISP_, for _MATH_.
The rectangle _MATH_ belongs to the class _MATH_. 
Therefore, if _MATH_ on a subset of _MATH_ with area not less than _MATH_, then _MATHDISP_. 
Consequently, _MATHDISP_. 
Inserting the sequence _MATH_, constructed in Lemma _REF_, into (_REF_), we obtain (_REF_) for any admissible set with area which does not exceed _MATH_. 
Thus, the lower bound for _MATH_ is obtained.
Several simulations have been made for different orientations, ring's dimensions, slit's width and conductivity. 
In this paper, most of the simulations are made on the torus _MATH_. 
It has a slit's width of _MATH_, an internal radius _MATH_ and an external redius _MATH_. 
We choose air as a host medium and a period of 1cm. 
The resonance is obtained at 8.18 GHz. 
The skin depth _MATH_ is ensured to be much smaller than the slit's width _MATH_ to maintain a coherent model of the ring.
The weighted norm inequalities above can be extended for a bilinear Calderon-Zygmund operator _MATH_ of type _MATH_ by controlling _MATH_ by _MATH_ and a bounded bilinear pointwise multiplier operator. 
More precisely, for _MATH_ and _MATH_ bounded and compactly supported, _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is a function satisfying _MATH_. 
This is proved using the arguments from the linear case (see _CITE_). 
Let _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_. 
Consider _MATH_ and let _MATH_ be a bilinear Calderon-Zygmund operator of type _MATH_ in _MATH_ with kernel _MATH_. 
Then for _MATH_ and _MATH_ bounded and compactly supported, _MATHDISP_. 
In particular, if _MATH_ we have _MATHDISP_, and therefore, _MATH_ extends as a bounded operator from _MATH_ into _MATH_. 
Adapting Remark 3.6 of Grafakos-Torres _CITE_, for _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ bounded and compactly supported, one can prove that _MATH_. 
Using the good-lambda inequality _REF_ and that _MATH_, we then obtain that _MATHDISP_. 
As a consequence of this and _REF_, _MATH_ extends as a bounded operator from _MATH_ into _MATH_ if _MATH_.
In YouTube, registered users may evaluate a video after watching it, giving a rate that varies from 1 (the lowest/worst) to 5 (the highest/best). 
Thus, we start our analysis by comparing the ratings assigned by users to different duplicates in each group. 
For each pair of duplicates within a group, we compute the absolute difference between their average ratings. 
Videos without ratings are not considered in this analysis. 
Intuitively, we would expect very small discrepancies in these differences, since the videos have similar or identical content. 
Figure _REF_ shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of these differences. 
We note that 23% of the pairs of ratings do not differ and, in 95% of them, the difference is at most 2. 
This result shows, as expected, that the majority of the duplicates are evaluated similarly by users. 
However, there is a small fraction of pairs (about 3%) with differences on ratings larger than 3. 
One possible explanation for such large differences could be related to the number of people who rated each video. 
For example, if a duplicate _MATH_ was evaluated by a single person and another duplicate of the same video, say _MATH_, was evaluated by 100 persons, we are comparing the perception or opinion of one unique person against the average rating given by 100 people, which may result in a large difference. 
In order to verify if this is the case, we calculate the ratio between the numbers of users who evaluated each pair of duplicates. 
Figure _REF_ shows the CDF of these ratios, in which pairs of duplicates are separated in certain fixed ranges based on the corresponding ratings differences. 
We observe that about 32% of the pairs with differences of ratings larger than 3 have ratio 1, i.e., their videos were evaluated by basically the same number of people. 
This value is higher than for pairs whose differences of ratings are smaller than 1, which is about 10%. 
Thus, we can conclude that such large differences are not caused by large variations in the number of user ratings but rather reflect, in fact, different user perceptions about the same content. 
Interestingly, similar results were found in systems of movie recommendation and evaluation _CITE_. 
As one might expect, it is quite possible that the same video (on a theater or on YouTube) may receive very different evaluations by different people.
We can see hence that anisotropy affects optimal solutions also in this case: the parameter k, determining the type of ordinary orthotropy, changes each optimal solution into an antioptimal one and vice-versa, whilst parameter _MATH_, along with the geometric parameter _MATH_, determines the region where the optimal solution is of the angle-ply type, i.e. the region where optimisation is meaningful. 
Actually, unidirectional laminates are limit solutions, and in such cases an optimization procedure, i.e. the computation of angle _MATH_ by eq. (_REF_), becomes unnecessary. 
Nevertheless, the value of these three solutions _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ can be compared. 
It is not difficult to find the following result: _MATHDISP_.
The image scale in kilometres per pixel is determined for the telescopic images relying on craters of known diameters. 
The dome diameter _MATH_ is measured in pixels, where for non-circular domes the geometric mean of the major and the minor axis is used. 
The height _MATH_ of a dome is obtained by measuring the depth difference in the reconstructed three-dimensional profile between the dome summit and the surrounding surface, taking into account the curvature of the lunar surface. 
The average flank slope _MATH_ is then obtained by _MATHDISP_. 
The dome volume _MATH_ is computed by integrating the DEM over an area corresponding to a circular region of diameter _MATH_ around the dome centre. 
If only a part of the dome can be reconstructed, as it is the case for a few domes in the Milichius field due to shadows cast on the dome surfaces by nearby hills, rotational symmetry is assumed, such that the volume can be estimated based on the rotational body formed by a cross-section through the dome centre. 
Lists of correspondingly determined morphometric properties of lunar domes are given e.g. by _CITE_ and _CITE_.
1) For any fixed _MATH_, the value process given at time _MATH_ by _MATH_ can be expressed in terms of the unique solution (_MATH_) of a BSDE of type (_REF_) given by (_MATH_) as _MATHDISP_. 
The constant _MATH_ corresponds to the risk aversion parameter _MATH_, _MATH_ is the contingent claim and _MATH_ is the generator, whose expression is given by _MATHDISP_.
There are several experimental and computational papers on bubble interaction reported in the literature _CITE_. 
However, there is a lack of works focusing on determining systematically and quantitatively the effect of radius of the bubble on the other bubbles' behavior. 
The results indicate that the motion of the bubble can be stable and chaotic in specific ranges (Fig. 7). 
Figure is also predict that the stable behavior of bubble has a complicated dependence on the ambient radius of the other bubbles.
Early in the radiation era, the Friedmann equation reads _MATHDISP_. 
Then we have _MATHDISP_. 
In the radiation era, the perturbed Einstein equations give us that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ runs over _MATH_, and _MATH_.
If _MATH_ is a cone in a real Banach space _MATH_ and _MATH_ are nonnegative continuous concave functionals on _MATH_ and _MATH_are nonnegative continuous convex functionals on _MATH_ and there exist positive numbers _MATH_ and _MATH_, such that _MATHDISP_ is a completely continuous operator, and _MATH_ is a bounded set. 
If
These results are summarized in Fig. 3, which completely shows, along with eqs. (_REF_), (_REF_) and (_REF_), the influence of the two anisotropic dimensionless parameters k and _MATH_ on the optimal, and antioptimal, solutions; in Fig. 2, the layer orientations of the different solutions are indicated by simple schemes.
The next two examples, Fig. _REF_, are used to illustrate the capabilities of the model to account for the effect of temperature on the material time dependent response. 
In the first example, Fig. _REF_.a, a set of creep tests at different temperature levels are performed. 
For all the tests, the same stress _MATH_ MPa, is used. 
The results suggest that for the given stress level, creep becomes relevant for temperatures above _MATH_. 
Moreover, once the threshold of _MATH_ is passed, a small increase in the temperature leads to a large increase in the creep strain rate (Fig. _REF_.a).
The independence of determinants implies _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_. 
With _MATH_, this becomes _MATHDISP_. 
Writing _REF_ as _MATH_, when _MATH_ we get _MATHDISP_. where _MATHDISP_. 
Solving the resulting equations for _MATH_ we verify that the only non-zero solutions correspond either to _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ with _MATH_, or to _MATH_ with _MATH_, _MATH_.
We consider a sequence of _MATH_ queueing models indexed by _MATH_ and then let _MATH_, where the arrival rate increases in _MATH_. 
We assume the system starts empty at time 0. 
As in Pang and Whitt (2010), we would analyze other initial content separately, which can be done because capacity is unlimited. 
For the _MATH_ system, the _MATH_ customer arrives at time _MATH_ with service time _MATH_ and receives service upon arrival. 
Let _MATH_ be the arrival counting process in the _MATH_ system. 
We assume that the sequence of arrival processes satisfies a FCLT as in Pang and Whitt (2010). 
All single-parameter continuous-time processes are assumed to be random elements in the function space _MATH_ with the Skorohod _MATH_ topology (Billingsley (1999), Whitt(2002)).
In this work we revisit algebraic linearization criteria for a system of two or more ODEs. 
The intention is to supplement the results of Wafo and Mahomed _CITE_ and importantly to complete the analysis of the algebraic linearization criteria for a system of two second-order ODEs via general point transformations. 
Moreover, this will also together with recent work _CITE_ present a complete picture on linearization via general point transformation for a system of two second-order ODEs. 
We also provide natural extensions of these algebraic criteria to arbitrary systems of second-order order ODEs.
For improving the performance of the proposed algorithm, the action probability vectors of LA should be updated. 
To this end, at each stage, the cardinality of the constructed cover set is computed and then compared to a dynamic threshold _MATH_ (initially set to M, the number of targets). 
According to the comparison result, if the cardinality of the cover set is less than or equal to the dynamic threshold _MATH_, the chosen action of all LA are rewarded; otherwise, they are penalized. 
It should be noted that this process (rewarding/penalizing) is performed only for the activated LA in Algorithm 3. 
At each stage, cardinality of the smallest cover set is a measure to which the dynamic threshold is set. 
The _MATH_-th iteration of the proposed algorithm thus is ended. 
As the algorithm goes on, the action probability vectors of LA converge to their optimal configuration. 
As a result, a cover set with a minimum number of active sensors is generated. 
The iterative process of constructing the cover sets and updating the action probability vectors continues until either the selection probability of sensor nodes in the cover set goes beyond a specified threshold _MATH_, or the number of generated cover sets becomes greater than a certain threshold _MATH_.
The first task in implementing an order-constrained _MATH_-means clustering strategy is to obtain an appropriate initial ordering to constrain the clustering in the first place. 
Although many strategies might be considered, a particularly powerful one appears definable through what is called the quadratic assignment (QA) task and a collection of local-improvement optimization heuristics discussed in Hubert, Arabie, and Meulman (2006). 
As typically defined, a QA problem involves two _MATH_ matrices, _MATH_ and _MATH_, and we seek a permutation to maximize the cross-product statistic _MATHDISP_. 
For our purposes, the first matrix _MATH_ is typically identified with the proximity matrix _MATH_ containing squared Euclidean distances between the subject profiles over the _MATH_ variables; the second matrix contains a target defined by a set of locations equally-spaced along a line, i.e., _MATH_ for _MATH_.
In this work, we made a detailed analysis and comparison of experimental data obtained with the FM laser spectroscopy for the D_MATH_ line in _MATH_Rb atoms and theoretical calculations based on the model described in Refs. _CITE_. 
For this, our simple model was extended on the case of a a real multilevel atom. 
In experiment, we measured dark resonances at the Zeeman sublevels of the transition _MATH_ in transmission spectra in the constant magnetic field. 
Simultaneously, the FM index was measured with the help of Fabri-Perot interferometer. 
FM spectra are registered either i) by scanning the modulation frequency at the fixed magnetic field or ii) by scanning the strength of the magnetic field at the fixed modulation frequency. 
Spectra obtained both these ways are in a good agreement with the theoretical model. 
Feasibility of using FM spectroscopy of dark resonances for optical magnetometry is also discussed. 
The estimated resolution for measuring a magnetic field _MATH_ in the range 10 G to 100 G is equal to _MATH_ for the measuring time _MATH_ ms in a cell of Rb atoms with a buffer gas. 
We also evaluate a working range for the magnetometer.
The conservation laws (_REF_) and (_REF_) work well in describing the background evolution of the universe. 
But in order to study the evolution of the density perturbation, we need a covariant form for the energy-momentum transfer between DE and CDM which holds in an inhomogeneous universe and reduces to Eqs.(_REF_) and (_REF_) in a homogeneous FRW universe. 
Usually, the covariant form for energy-momentum transfer is taken to be _CITE_ _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ to denote CDM and DE respectively and _MATH_ in order for the total energy-momentum tensor to be conserved. 
In Ref._CITE_, it is assumed that _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the four velocity of CDM. 
The conclusions in _CITE_ are based on the above ansatz.
1. 
Full-disk H_MATH_ line center images from the global H_MATH_ five-station network _CITE_. 
The stations are Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) in the U.S.
A, Kanzelhohe Solar Observatory (KSO) in Austria, Catania Astrophysical Observatory in Italy, Yunnan Astronomical Observatory and Huairou Solar observing Station in China. 
The observations at KSO and BBSO covered the event well. 
The KSO's (BBSO's) images are acquired using a Zeiss (Halle) Lyot filter with a bandpass of _MATH_0.7 √Ö(_MATH_0.5 √Ö) and are recorded by 2048 _MATH_ 2048 Apogee 14 bit KX4 camera. 
The cadence of the H_MATH_ images is 1 minute, and the pixel size is roughly _MATH_, which yields a spatial resolution of _MATH_. 
Daily H_MATH_ data from other stations are also examined.
When a star fills its Roche lobe (_MATH_), the stability of the binary against dynamical time scale mass transfer depends on whether adiabatic perturbations to the system are damped or unstable. 
That criterion for stability can be written as _CITE_ _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the stellar adiabatic radius-mass exponent, and _MATH_ is the time-independent first-order response of the Roche lobe to mass transfer. 
In the simplest models of mass transfer, in which systemic mass and orbital angular momentum loss rates are proportional to the mass transfer rate, _MATH_ depends only on the binary mass ratio. 
Our stellar adiabatic mass loss models therefore allow us to determine the critical mass ratio (donor/accretor) above which a binary will be unstable to dynamical time scale mass transfer. 
This is an essential consideration in mapping out binary population synthesis models. 
We are currently building a library of stellar adiabatic mass loss models (Ge et al. in preparation), covering the full range of evolutionary stages from ZAMS to the tip of the RGB or AGB, as appropriate. 
Fig. _REF_ shows the model grid of our project.
Letting _MATH_, we wish to evaluate _MATH_. 
The derivation is identical to the steps in the proof of Theorem _REF_ except that _MATH_ replaces _MATH_, until step _REF_, which becomes: _MATHDISP_, Applying this expression yields a positive weighted sum of partial derivatives _REF_: _MATHDISP_. 
By _REF_, each of these partial derivative terms is non-positive, so _MATH_ if at least one term is non-zero. 
To have all partial derivatives be 0 requires _MATH_ for some _MATH_, hence _MATH_ if _MATH_ for every _MATH_.
Finally, we observe that within our model (whether in the case _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ finite, or in the case _MATH_ and _MATH_), we have similar results if we assume that the portfolio strategy _MATH_ belong to _MATH_ with _MATH_, i.e., if the pension fund is forced not to invest the total amount of its wealth in the risky asset. 
Sometimes this constraint is imposed by the supervisory authority (see e.g. _CITE_).
Following the steps of _CITE_, we now define the Zener parameter and the drag strength. 
For the Zener parameter, we depart, as done before by _CITE_ and _CITE_, from the hyperbolic sine function given by _CITE_ for steady-state creep: _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and _MATH_ are temperature independent material constants and _MATH_ is the so-called power-law breakdown strength. 
The advantage of adopting a hyperbolic sine function for _MATH_ is its ability to model either the power-law or exponential creep regime depending on the stress level. 
For stresses below the power-law breakdown, _REF_ reduces to power-law creep where dislocation climb is the rate controlling mechanism. 
On the other hand, for stresses above the power-law breakdown, where dislocation glide is the rate controlling mechanism, _REF_ becomes exponential _CITE_.
Nota Bene: Mark Coffey _CITE_ supposed that the contour integration evaluation may be possible for integral b). 
Regrettably, he did not indicate how to circumvent the problem of branch points that have both logarithm and arctangent (we pointed out the importance of this problem in Section _REF_).
We close this section with the promised proof of Lemma _REF_. 
We proceed in two steps. 
In the first step, we consider the special case when the two stencils that are used by the ENO reconstruction in cells _MATH_ and _MATH_ are only one grid cell apart. 
Such stencils must have the same offset, say _MATH_ and in this case, Lemma _REF_ claims that _MATH_ equals _MATHDISP_. 
Indeed, the interpolant of _MATH_, assembled in the specified order from left to right and then adding _MATH_ at the end, is given by _MATHDISP_. 
Similarly, the interpolant of _MATH_, assembled in the specified order from left to right, is given by _MATHDISP_ (cf. _REF_). 
Thus, their difference amounts to _MATHDISP_, which reflects the fact that _MATH_ and _MATH_ coincide at the _MATH_ points _MATH_. 
Differentiation yields _MATHDISP_. 
At _MATH_, all product terms on the right vanish except for _MATH_, since _MATH_ belongs to both stencils. 
We end up with _MATHDISP_. 
This shows that (_REF_) holds, verifying Lemma _REF_ in the case that the stencils associated with _MATH_ and _MATH_ are separated by just one cell.
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation with fractional transversality conditions have been presented for fractional variational problems with fractional like action written in terms of fractional scaling time parameter of order _MATH_. 
It is shown that for the case _MATH_, our results will go to those obtained in [37]. 
One example was investigated in detail. 
We reported that for _MATH_ the form of the obtained equations are different from the classical ones but when _MATH_ approaches to 1 the classical results are reobtained. 
The obtained results offer a better model useful to describe the dynamics of the complex viscous systems mainly because the fractional integral describes the memory effects.
In this section, we review some basic properties of the Dirichlet process (DP). 
First, suppose _MATH_ corresponds to a _MATH_ prior, which is a Dirichlet process with precision parameter _MATH_ and base distribution _MATH_. 
For example, _MATH_ may correspond to a normal distribution. 
Then, any realization _MATH_ from _MATH_ will be discrete, implying that individuals will be grouped into clusters. 
This clustering will occur through the DP prediction rule, or Polya urn scheme, which was originally described by Blackwell and MacQueen (1973). 
Assuming that _MATH_, with _MATH_, then the Polya urn scheme implies that _MATH_ where _MATH_ is a degenerate distribution with all its mass on _MATH_. 
Hence, the first subject has their latent variable value drawn from _MATH_; and as subjects are added they are either grouped with one of the existing subjects or allocated to a new cluster, with probability decreasing as the number of subjects increases. 
This allows there to be infinitely many latent classes represented in the population, with _MATH_ classes represented in the current sample. 
Allowing the number of latent classes to grow slowly with the sample size is more realistic, in most applications, than assuming a fixed, finite number of classes.
We repeated the simulations using various values of _MATH_, to analyze how the evolution of the piston/wave system depends on the impulsiveness of the source-region expansion. 
A stronger _MATH_ results in a more impulsive source-region acceleration, which leads to a higher shock amplitude and Mach number. 
Furthermore, the shock is created earlier and closer to the piston, so in the case of extremely impulsive expansions, the shock-sheath region and the source region cannot be clearly resolved.
Figure _REF_ (panels (a) and (d)) present the diagnostic plots suggested by _CITE_. 
These are the row and column faces of the sample values of the empirical semi-variogram of the residuals from model 1 in Table _REF_. 
These plots are augmented with the mean and 95% point-wise coverage intervals of the faces of the empirical semi-variogram from a parametric boostrap sample of size 100. 
This proceedure is fully descibed in _CITE_, essentially the current model is simulated 100 times using the current variance components and the sample variogram is calculated for each simulation. 
The 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles are obtained and included in figure _REF_. 
There are clear and systematic discrepancies between the mean row and column faces of the parametric bootstrap sample and the residuals from model 1. 
In both figures the mean is generally higher for all lags. 
This indicates the presence of both row and column effects.
Indeed, the potential impact of welfare programs on family structure is a highly contentious issue. 
A substantial US literature examines whether more generous welfare programs are associated with higher rates of female household headship. 
Much of this literature has exploited variation across US states to identify the effect of welfare. 
While the early literature found statistically significant effects the more recent literature has highlighted the fragility of these results. 
Moffitt (1994) showed that the estimates of the effect of welfare benefits on female headship are highly sensitive to the inclusion of state-fixed effects. 
Hoynes (1997) took one further step by adding individual-fixed effects; she shows that welfare benefits are positively correlated with both individual and state effects, casting serious doubt on the results from the early literature: when both individual and state effects are included there is no longer any statistically significant effect of welfare. 
A few recent studies have looked more particularly at the potential effect of the EITC. 
Eissa and Hoynes (2003) exploit a number of policy changes, including the EITC expansion, to identify the effect of taxes and transfers on marital status. 
They find that taxes and transfers do affect marriage behavior, but that the responses are quite modest (see below).
We apply Theorem _REF_ to the IVP _MATHDISP_, and the two-point BVP _MATHDISP_, where _MATHDISP_, _MATHDISP_ and _MATH_, _MATH_ are nonnegative continuous functions on _MATH_ (for problem (_REF_)) or _MATH_ (for problem (_REF_)). 
(Dajun Guo, _CITE_) Suppose that _MATH_, _MATH_ for _MATH_ and _MATHDISP_. 
Then IVP(_REF_) has exactly one nonnegative nontrivial _MATH_ solution _MATH_ on _MATH_. 
Moreover, constructing successively sequence of functions _MATHDISP_, _MATH_ for any initial nonnegative function _MATH_, the sequence _MATH_ converges to _MATH_ uniformly on _MATH_. 
It is clear that _MATH_ is a nonnegative solution of (_REF_) if and only if _MATH_ is a nonnegative solution of the following integral equation _MATHDISP_.
Then _MATH_ has a unique fixed point _MATH_ in _MATH_. 
And for any _MATH_, constructing successively the sequences _MATHDISP_ we have _MATHDISP_. 
Define _MATHDISP_. 
It is easy to show _MATHDISP_. 
By (_REF_), _MATHDISP_. 
Let _MATHDISP_ then _MATH_.
With lemma _REF_, _MATH_ is a right dipterous algebra. 
In the same way, _MATH_ is a left dipterous algebra. 
It remains to show the entanglement relation: for all _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
This calculation is still true if _MATH_, _MATH_ or _MATH_ is equal to 1 or if _MATH_ and _MATH_. 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
If _MATH_ and _MATH_, it is the same calculation as previously. 
Finally if _MATH_, _MATHDISP_. 
Consider the periodic boundary value problem _REF_-_REF_, where _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ are linear positive operators with norms _MATH_, _MATH_, 1 is the unit function. 
An absolutely continuous function _MATH_ is called a solution of the problem if it satisfies the periodic boundary condition _REF_ and equation _REF_ for almost all _MATH_. 
We have to solve problem _REF_-_REF_ if, for example, we search periodic solutions of the equation with delay _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_, _MATH_ are _MATH_-periodic locally integrable functions, _MATH_ is a measurable _MATH_-periodic nonnegative delay. 
Indeed, suppose that linear operators _MATH_ and _MATH_- are defined by the equalities _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ and the integer numbers _MATH_ are such that _MATH_ for almost all _MATH_. 
It is easy to show that problem _REF_-_REF_ has a solution if and only if equation _REF_ has a periodic solution with the period _MATH_.
The derivatives _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, and _MATH_, which are needed for the calculation of the control input in (_REF_) and (_REF_), were obtained by passing _MATH_ and _MATH_ through a 3rd order low-pass filtering reference model (see Appendix _REF_). 
The parameters of the reference model were set to _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Our renormalization of the strong coupling constant, _MATH_, is described in Refs. _CITE_ (and references therein). 
The decoupling of the heavy particles is taken into account in the definition of _MATH_: Starting point is _MATH_ _CITE_, where the running can also be found in Ref. _CITE_. 
From the _MATH_ value the _MATH_ value is obtained at the two-loop level (with _MATH_ for _MATH_) via _CITE_ _MATHDISP_ 
Within the MSSM _MATH_ to one-loop reads _MATHDISP_, with _MATH_. 
The log terms origin from the decoupling of the SUSY QCD (SQCD) particles from the running of _MATH_ at lower scales _MATH_.
While similar size and composition thrombi develop in our simulations for different transition values _MATH_ for the onset of strong transport hinderance, there are small differences in the results that are worth noting, because they provide additional insight. 
Looking at Figs. 6A, 6C, and 5C, respectively, we see a somewhat earlier rise in the density of TF:VIIa on the subendothelium, in the production of factor Xa by TF:VIIa, and in the concentration of platelet-bound tenase for the _MATH_ case than for the _MATH_ case. 
This is attributable to an early higher factor Xa concentration near the subendothelium because of the greater hindrance to its removal in the _MATH_ case, which leads to more feedback activation of TF:VIIa by factor Xa. 
The earlier rise in platelet-bound tenase in the _MATH_ case is because factor Xa and factor IXa (not shown) "trapped" near the subendothelium have more opportunity to carry out the reactions necessary for tenase formation. 
Figure 9 shows that the eventual spatial distribution of tenase in the two simulations is very similar. 
There is a reduction in the extent of the spatial distribution of prothrombinase in the _MATH_ case (see Fig. 7), presumably because less factor X is available where tenase is located and consequently less factor Xa is produced on the platelets, and even less of this factor Xa moves out toward the edge of the clot. 
The net result is that a somewhat smaller clot forms in the _MATH_ case.
Before we focus on the spectral functions we briefly discuss our results for the Matsubara propagator in momentum space shown in Fig. _REF_. 
The results are obtained employing a sharp cutoff _MATH_ for the computation of the self-energy. 
Thus the integration and summation extends to momenta and frequencies with _MATH_. 
For _MATH_ the summation over Matsubara frequencies is performed explicitly. 
The remaining sum is approximated by an integral and we checked that the results are insensitive to a change of the number of explicitly summed Matsubara modes. 
We then use a MOM-renormalization scheme with renormalization conditions _MATH_ and _MATH_ and _MATH_ _MATH_; consequently all dressing functions are independent of the cutoff _MATH_. 
More details concerning the numerical procedure can be found in Ref. _CITE_.
Figure _REF_ conceptualizes the actors, information, and steps that are involved in human computation.
To investigate the bistability we use the combination of the averaging and parameter continuation technique. 
Figure _REF_ illustrates the results obtained for the interneuron model (_REF_). 
Inset A1 of the figure shows that when the slow nullcline _MATH_ cuts through the spiking manifold _MATH_ at negative values of the bifurcation parameter _MATH_, the corresponding slow average equation (_REF_) has a single zero of _MATH_ (Inset A2) corresponding to a stable (tonic spiking) periodic orbit (shown in green). 
Recall that the when the slow nullcline the phase point is pushed by the flow (slow equation in (_REF_)) so that its _MATH_-coordinate increases, or decreases otherwise. 
If the phase point stays on a periodic orbit, the opposite forces are canceled out on average, over the period of the orbit. 
This results in a circular motion of the phase point around the "center of gravity" of the periodic orbit. 
The (_MATH_)-coordinates of this center are given by _MATHDISP_, where _MATH_ is the equation of the periodic orbit. 
The position of the periodic orbit on _MATH_ and the gravity center depend on where the slow nullcline _MATH_ cuts through _MATH_. 
By increasing the parameter _MATH_, the slow nullcline lowers, and the periodic orbit slides along _MATH_ in the direction of increasing _MATH_. 
Hence, while _MATH_ is varied, the gravity center traces down a space curve, denoted by _MATH_ in the figures depicting the phase space of the interneuron model, of the average coordinates of all periodic orbits forming _MATH_. 
A fold of the curve _MATH_ (Fig. _REF_) corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits; there are two such bifurcations occurring at _MATH_ and _MATH_ (Fig. _REF_). 
Note that in order to accurately describe the evolution of periodic orbit one has to work with the averaged branches, as 2D projections may be misleading. 
For example, we can see from Fig. _REF_ that it is the average branch _MATH_ that glues to the hyperpolarized fold on the quiescent manifold _MATH_ at _MATH_. 
This corresponds to a homoclinic saddle-node or SNIC bifurcation: the closer the periodic orbit approaches the equilibrium state, the longer the phase point lingers near the "ghost" of the saddle-node equilibrium state. 
This makes the period of the orbit greater, which implies that _MATH_ gets closer to the _MATH_-coordinate of the bifurcating equilibrium state (fold point). 
Observe another peculiar feature of the _MATH_ branch: its inflection point (labeled PD) at _MATH_ corresponds to a period doubling bifurcation.
Since _MATH_ is a smooth surface, we have _MATHDISP_ for all _MATH_. 
Hence, according to the second part of Theorem _REF_, _MATHDISP_ for any admissible subset _MATH_ of _MATH_. 
Thus, _MATHDISP_ and therefore _MATH_ for small values of _MATH_. 
Since _MATH_ is nondecreasing in _MATH_, we conclude that _MATH_ for all _MATH_. 
The lemma is proved. 
A single-phase, homogeneous ceramic sample of LiCoO_MATH_ was prepared by sintering a mixture of Co_MATH_O_MATH_ and Li_MATH_CO_MATH_. 
Nonstoichiometric lithium cobaltites Li_MATH_CoO_MATH_ (_MATH_-0.96) were obtained by extracting lithium from LiCoO_MATH_ at room temperature _CITE_. 
Li concentrations were estimated by means of atom-absorption analysis using a spectrophotometer Perkin-Elmer 503. 
The phase composition was checked by X-ray diffraction analysis using an X-ray diffractometer STADI-P (STOE) and by magnetic susceptibility measurements. 
Characterization of the samples is more detail described elsewhere _CITE_.
The above inequality (_REF_) implies that the inter sampling times _MATH_ taking for _MATH_ to evolve from 0 to _MATH_ are lower bounded by the time _MATH_ during which _MATH_ evolve from 0 to _MATH_.
Central banks deploy different mechanisms to implement their monetary policy. 
The recent market turmoil has highlighted the way in which differing tools can give rise to completely different outcomes, in particular in terms of short-term interest rate patterns. 
During the financial market crisis, the ability of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to stabilize its target rate has been observed with much interest by many specialists. 
For instance, in its Survey magazine, the International Monetary Fund pointed out that "(T)he Swiss (monetary) approach imparts a degree of flexibility, which has served it well during the turbulence in financial markets." 
Probably the most noticeable characteristic of the SNB's monetary strategy is the balance between its long-term objective of price stability and the pragmatic short-term flexibility of its implementation mechanism. 
The intellectual background to this combination is discussed in Baltensperger, Hildebrand and Jordan (2007). 
The former property, i.e. a firm long-term anchor for nominal stability, has assured stable prices, which are an important prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the economy. 
The latter property, i.e. short-term flexibility in policy implementation, has two aspects. 
First, it assures regular functioning of liquidity provision in normal times and a swift response to exogenous shocks to the financial market. 
Second, it is an effective tool for achieving the intended policy stance in turbulent times.
We assume that the coefficients _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_, _MATH_ and _MATH_ have the following forms _MATHDISP_, for all _MATH_.
The case of cylinders of equal radii arises in the motion planning problem of a ball amid line obstacles in _MATH_. 
If the obstacles are _MATH_ pairwise disjoint cylinders, then the complement of the union of their Minkowski sums with the moving ball is the free space for the center of the ball. 
Since these sums are possibly intersecting cylinders of non-equal radii (where each cylinder radius is the sum of the corresponding obstacle radius and the ball radius), our result implies that the combinatorial complexity of the free space is _MATH_, for any _MATH_. 
Note that the problem studied in this paper is more general, in the sense that it extends to any set of (possibly intersecting) cylinders, and not only to settings obtained by the motion planning problem.
In all this section _MATH_ are two partitions of respective sizes _MATH_ and _MATH_.
Before preceding to a precise definition of the set of pairs of strings, we explain why we can assume without loss of generality the requirement that the pair _MATH_ appears first in a match. 
So let us introduce the PCP with this requirement as the modified Post correspondence problem (MPCP for short) as follows: when given a list of pairs of strings _MATH_, decide whether there exists a sequence of subscripts _MATH_, _MATH_, ..., _MATH_ such that _MATH_. 
So far we constructed MPCP _MATH_ that simulates TM _MATH_. 
In what follows we show that, in general, we can modify somehow MPCP _MATH_ to obtain PCP _MATH_ that behaves essentially the same way as MPCP _MATH_ even if we disregard the requirement that _MATH_ must be used first. 
This is done by adding new symbols to _MATH_ so that a match of _MATH_ must start necessarily with the pair _MATH_ and otherwise _MATH_ and _MATH_ manipulate strings substantially the same way.
In principle all the needed information can be obtained from these equations via the Stieltjes inversion formula, and various calculus methods for small degree polynomials.
The tightness of the processes _MATH_ and _MATH_ follows from the Assumption 1, and from applying the CMT to the mapping in _REF_.
Let _MATH_ be the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial _MATH_ (with respect to _MATH_). 
Recall that _MATH_ if and only if _MATH_ admits a multiple root, that is, if and only if the trisector is not a smooth quartic. 
The discriminant _MATH_, computed with Maple _CITE_, is equal to _MATHDISP_ times a factor that we refer to as the gros facteur which is a rather large polynomial, of degree 18 in 5 variables with 253 monomials, of which we only show 2 out of 22 lines: _MATHDISP_.
Combining Eqs.(_REF_) and (_REF_) the square of the velocity _MATH_ of the scalar field becomes _MATHDISP_, and the effective potential can be write _MATHDISP_. 
Note that in the low-energy limit, _MATH_, the expressions for _MATH_ and the scalar potential _MATH_ given by Eqs.(_REF_) and (_REF_), reduce to the standard inflation, where _MATH_ and _MATH_, see Ref. _CITE_. 
Note also that in the high energy limit, _MATH_, the values of _MATH_ and the scalar potential _MATH_ reduce to the brane world cosmology in which, _MATH_ and _MATH_ _CITE_.
Based on the analysis of the obtained experimental data and the numerical examples, it can be concluded that the influence of temperature on the mechanical behavior of pearlitic steels becomes significant for temperatures above _MATH_. 
From this point onwards, there is a strong dependency of the mechanical properties on temperature. 
This results in a fast decrease of the material resistance to deformation with increasing temperature. 
This effect is observed in the drop of the flow stress and the sharp increase in the creep strain rate. 
Consequently, the creep resistance of the material deteriorates dramatically above the _MATH_ temperature threshold and for certain stress levels failure can take place in a matter of hours.
Liu [7] studied the existence and multiplicity of (1.1), (1.2) with _MATH_, by using the fixed point theorem in cones, he proved the following
Several studies have shown that fractal and multifractal parameters (hereafter referred to as complexity indicators) derived from photospheric magnetic field measurements may help assessing the eruptive potential of Active Regions (ARs) (see, e.g. _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; _CITE_; and _CITE_, for the studies carried out during the last decade). 
However, the recent results by _CITE_ refute the previously collected evidences, by showing that none of the three widely-used indicators analyzed in that study allows to distinguish ARs with major flares from flare-quiet ones. 
_CITE_ attributes the inability of complexity indicators to discriminate the flare activity of ARs to the processes underlying the solar magnetism and the structuring of magnetic features in the solar atmosphere, as well as to the origin of solar eruptive events in the outer solar atmosphere, with lack of effects in lower layers.
Although the _MATH_ for _MATH_ is lower than that for _MATH_, many of the decisions come at the cost of interpretability. 
First, putting the scorpion in its own cluster causes a reduction in clusters from the _MATH_ solution-perhaps the less defined Mammalian clusters. 
Gaining the split between the fish cluster (which is not clearly interpretable), comes at the cost of destroying the _MATH_ cluster, resulting in weird placement of the toad and tortoise. 
Similar to the other solutions examined here, the natural structure between the clusters is lost when examining the _MATH_ solution.
For a one-part partition _MATH_, we have _MATHDISP_
In the cartesian case, one can define the average permeability at the location _MATH_ as being an orthoradial spatial average of the log-permeability _MATHDISP_ 
For simplicity, we will take _MATH_ and we will denote the random variable _MATH_ at radius _MATH_ by _MATHDISP_ 
The random variable _MATH_ is built normal. 
Without loss of generality, we suppose that it is centred. 
Thus, _MATH_ is log-normal and we have, _MATHDISP_ 
This can be recast into the following form, _MATHDISP_ With the definition of _MATH_ _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is a stationary process by construction. 
We calculate its second moment _MATHDISP_ 
Due to stationarity, this previous equality can be expressed with a simple integral of the prior covariance _MATH_ such as _MATHDISP_ Using the definition of the Gaussian variogram for the prior covariance and the parametrization _MATH_, with _MATH_, we obtain _MATHDISP_ where _MATH_ is the 0-order Bessel function. 
And so, _MATHDISP_ 
An analogous operation can be done for the curve _MATH_ with _MATH_, where _MATH_, and we obtain then _MATHDISP_
A location map _MATH_ is created by assigning '1' to _MATH_ in Class 1 and a '0' to _MATH_ in Class 2. 
And then it is losslessly compressed by arithmetic encoder into a bitstream _MATH_ with an end of message symbol at the end.
Considering Thm. _REF_ and applying Thm. _REF_ to each sub-DSR-graph corresponding to a principal minor of _MATH_, one can see that a necessary condition for multistationarity is that some term of the sum is negative. 
This again states the usual condition about the existence of a positive cycle in the influence graph of _MATH_.
A fractional order filters is characterized by its transfer function that contains rational power of s in its characteristics polynomial. 
In this work, a biquad filter is considered for design and realization purposes where three possible filter responses i.e. low pass response, high pass response and band pass response can be obtained as shown in Fig._REF_. 
The filter uses two different fractional order capacitances (_MATH_ and _MATH_).
